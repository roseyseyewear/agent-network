## Key Conversations & Context

### Important Memory Preservation Discussion
**Context**: User realized chat history isn't automatically saved to Git, only files and commit messages
**Decision**: Enhanced session logging system to capture important conversations
**Implementation**: 
- Added "Memory & Context Preservation" section to claude.md
- Created enhanced session log template
- Established protocol: Claude proactively offers to log important discussions
- User can request with "save this to memory" or "log this conversation"

**Why This Matters**: Ensures strategic discussions and context don't get lost between sessions

### Critical Startup Procedure Resolution
**Problem**: User's startup instructions failed - `--context` flag doesn't exist in Claude Code
**Troubleshooting**: Checked `.\claude.bat --help` to find correct flags
**Solution Found**: Use continuation flags instead of context loading

**CORRECTED Startup Instructions**:
```bash
cd C:\claude_home
.\claude.bat -c
```

**Alternative Options**:
- `.\claude.bat -r` (resume with interactive selection)
- `.\claude.bat --settings ClaudeSystem\claude.md` (if settings format works)

**Key Discovery**: `-c, --continue` flag continues most recent conversation with full context
**Why This Works**: Preserves all session context, file access, and conversation history

**User Should Update Their Instructions Document** with the corrected startup procedure.

## Key Insights Captured
