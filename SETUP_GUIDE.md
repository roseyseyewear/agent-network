# Setup Guide - Business Agent Network

## Phase 1: Environment Setup (15 minutes)

### Prerequisites Check
- [ ] Claude Code access working
- [ ] Python 3.10+ installed (`python --version`)
- [ ] Basic understanding of your business priorities

### Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Test Installation
```bash
python -c "from autonomous_working_agents import MetaAgentSupervisor; print('System ready!')"
```

## Phase 2: Business Configuration (30 minutes)

### Create Your Business Context File
Your Claude will help you create a `CLAUDE.md` configuration file with:

1. **Business Overview**
   - What your company does
   - Main products/services
   - Current business model
   - Key team members

2. **Current Priorities**
   - Short-term goals (this week/month)
   - Medium-term objectives (next quarter)
   - Long-term vision (this year)

3. **Communication Preferences**
   - How you like to receive information
   - Decision-making style
   - Quality standards and expectations

### Sample Configuration Structure
```markdown
# My Business Configuration

## Business Details
- **Company**: [Your company name]
- **Main Service**: [What you do]
- **Target Market**: [Who you serve]
- **Team Size**: [Current team]

## Current Focus
- **Priority 1**: [Most important current goal]
- **Priority 2**: [Second priority]  
- **Priority 3**: [Third priority]

## Preferences
- **Communication**: [Direct/Detailed/etc.]
- **Decision Speed**: [Fast/Thorough/etc.]
- **Quality Level**: [High/Balanced/etc.]
```

## Phase 3: Agent Testing (30 minutes)

### Test Individual Agents
Start with simple tasks to verify each agent works:

```python
# Test Research Agent
test_task = {'id': 'test1', 'name': 'Research best project management tools'}

# Test Business Analysis Agent  
test_task = {'id': 'test2', 'name': 'Analyze our current marketing strategy'}

# Test Vendor Selection Agent
test_task = {'id': 'test3', 'name': 'Find web development contractors'}
```

### Run Your First Agent Session
```bash
python autonomous_working_agents.py
```

The system will:
1. Load your business configuration
2. Assign test tasks to appropriate agents
3. Execute work with quality control
4. Generate reports for your review

## Phase 4: Integration Setup (45 minutes)

### Option A: ClickUp Integration
If you use ClickUp:
1. Get your API key from ClickUp settings
2. Create `.env` file: `CLICKUP_API_KEY=your_key_here`
3. Update list IDs in scripts to match your ClickUp setup
4. Test with: `python clickup_analysis_tools/clickup_integration.py`

### Option B: Manual Task Entry
If you don't use ClickUp:
1. Prepare a list of 10-20 current business tasks
2. Categorize them roughly (research, admin, strategy, etc.)
3. Create task assignments manually for testing
4. Use the system to process and improve your task list

### Option C: Other Task Systems
For other platforms:
1. Export your current task list to CSV or text
2. Your Claude will help adapt the integration scripts
3. Or start with manual entry and optimize later

## Phase 5: Customization (1-2 hours)

### Adapt Agents to Your Business
Work with your Claude to:

1. **Modify Agent Specializations**
   - Adjust research agent for your industry
   - Customize business analysis for your market
   - Tailor vendor selection for your needs

2. **Set Quality Standards**
   - Adjust confidence thresholds
   - Define what constitutes good work for your business
   - Set expectations for completeness and detail

3. **Add Business Knowledge**
   - Include industry-specific context
   - Add competitor information
   - Include past decision history and outcomes

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Setup Problems
**Issue**: Import errors or missing packages
**Solution**: 
```bash
pip install --upgrade requests python-dotenv
python --version  # Verify 3.10+
```

**Issue**: Scripts don't find business configuration
**Solution**: Make sure CLAUDE.md is in the same directory as scripts

### Agent Performance Issues
**Issue**: Agents produce generic or low-quality work
**Solution**: 
- Add more specific business context to configuration
- Include examples of good vs bad work
- Lower confidence threshold temporarily for testing

**Issue**: Agents take too long or seem stuck
**Solution**:
- Start with simpler, more specific tasks
- Check system resources (close other applications)
- Run agents individually first, then together

### Integration Problems
**Issue**: ClickUp connection fails
**Solution**:
- Verify API key is correct and has proper permissions
- Check that list IDs match your actual ClickUp lists
- Test internet connection and ClickUp service status

## Success Indicators

### After 1 Hour (Basic Setup)
- [ ] System loads without errors
- [ ] Business configuration complete
- [ ] First test session runs successfully
- [ ] Agents produce recognizable work output

### After 1 Day (Full Testing)
- [ ] Multiple agent types tested successfully
- [ ] Work quality meets basic business standards
- [ ] Time savings measurable (even if small)
- [ ] System integrated with your task workflow

### After 1 Week (Production Ready)
- [ ] Agents consistently produce useful work
- [ ] Quality control prevents low-value interruptions
- [ ] Measurable efficiency improvements
- [ ] Comfortable delegating routine tasks to system

## Beta Testing Checklist

### Track These Metrics
- [ ] Setup time (how long from start to first working session)
- [ ] Task completion improvement (before/after agent help)
- [ ] Work quality (examples of good and poor agent output)
- [ ] Time savings (hours per week reclaimed)
- [ ] Business impact (better decisions, faster execution)

### Document Your Experience
- [ ] What was confusing during setup?
- [ ] Which agents work best for your business type?
- [ ] What missing features would add the most value?
- [ ] Any technical problems or performance issues?
- [ ] Overall satisfaction and likelihood to recommend?
