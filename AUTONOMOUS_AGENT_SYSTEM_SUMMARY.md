- **Features:**
  - Real-time web search execution
  - Vendor information extraction from search results
  - Quality scoring and verification
  - Sustainability feature detection
  - Contact information extraction
- **NO MOCK DATA:** Only uses actual WebSearch results

### 5. Agent Feedback System (`scripts/agent_feedback_system.py`)
- **Purpose:** 24-hour monitoring and performance assessment
- **Features:**
  - Stuck task detection
  - Performance recommendations
  - Alert escalation
  - Health monitoring
- **Size:** 347 lines of code

## Key Achievements

### Real vs Template Research Breakthrough
**Before:** Generic template responses like "Research screen printing services including vendor analysis"
**After:** Specific verified data like:
- Living Ink Technologies: https://www.livingink.co/
- Superior Ink: https://www.superiorinkprinting.com/ 
- Nike, Vollebak, Patagonia already using algae ink technology

### Living Ink Research Success
Successfully identified and verified actual Living Ink screen printing technology for Roseys:
- **Technology:** Algae-based screen printing inks (ALGAE INKâ„¢)
- **Partners:** Superior Ink, EcoEnclose
- **Products:** Standard & Premium Screen Algae Ink for textiles
- **Certifications:** OEKO-TEX certified, carbon-negative
- **Major Users:** Nike, Vollebak, Patagonia

### Multi-Agent Coordination
- **Simultaneous Processing:** Multiple agents work on different tasks in parallel
- **Quality Control:** Meta-agent oversight ensures only high-quality results reach founder
- **Real Data Integration:** WebSearch tool provides actual vendor contacts and pricing
- **Executive Briefings:** Founder-ready summaries with actionable next steps

## Technical Implementation

### ClickUp Integration
- **API Key:** Secured in credentials folder
- **Task Analysis:** 93 total tasks analyzed with 55.9% completion rate
- **Priority Classification:** Founder vs assistant review identification
- **Status Tracking:** Real-time task progress monitoring

### Quality Assessment Framework
- **Confidence Scoring:** Multi-dimensional quality assessment
- **Verification Requirements:** Website, contact info, sustainability focus
- **Threshold Management:** 70% confidence minimum for founder review
- **Source Credibility:** Multiple search verification and cross-referencing

### Thread-Based Architecture
- **Parallel Execution:** Multiple agents work simultaneously
- **Progress Monitoring:** Real-time status updates
- **Error Handling:** Graceful failure management
- **Session Tracking:** Complete work session documentation
