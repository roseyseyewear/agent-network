   - Main orchestrator for task management
   - Provides daily briefings and priority discussions
   - Delegates tasks to specialized agents
   - Monitors progress and coordinates feedback

2. **Specialized Agents** (within `task_coordinator_agent.py`)
   - **Research Agent**: Information gathering, vendor research, business solutions
   - **Calendar Agent**: Scheduling, calendar management, appointments
   - **Email Agent**: Communication, follow-ups, contact coordination
   - **Business Operations Agent**: Roseys and Luna Wild business tasks
   - **Administrative Agent**: Insurance, legal, administrative tasks

3. **Automated Feedback System** (`scripts/agent_feedback_system.py`)
   - Progress monitoring and task health analysis
   - Automated escalation for stuck or overdue tasks
   - Performance tracking and recommendations
   - Intelligent alerts and status reporting

4. **Main Launcher** (`scripts/hannah_assistant.py`)
