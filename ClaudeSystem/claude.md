## FYI - The Game Plan For Now ##

this document provides a high level structure for what I'm looking to achieve. I would like this agent to help me continuously update this and maybe like the first thing that we could do is work on just making sure that we have all the goals and active projects and everything else really clearly documented and verified by me, map out the different swimlanes of the business, and get this agent connected to my document folders that have detailed information about the business to expand into planning and prioritizing mode, after that we will start building specialized agents who we can delegate tasks to, review work, and be overseen by our human assistant and founder, we will also make a agent specialized in evaluating tasks for human vs agent assignee, it would be great to connect those agents to clickup so they could be assigned that way and complete and update the tasks when theyre done or need feedback, im also open to use a different platform than clickup if one is better, ive been on it a long time and now is the time to establish the best workflow for the company. finally we should connect to clickup and start organizing my personal to do list in a similar fashion and delegating between specialized agents that we design and my two personal assistants Hannah and Heloisa and my web developer Altaf and my intern Ximena.



In addition to all this, I first want to connect claude code somehow to github so it tracks changes in anything we do, connects to my obsidian notebook where it can read and write new documents for the plans and knowledge base as we grow. I want a living record of its growth through GitHub. 





\## Resources \& File Storage Locations ##






Obsidian will be my new main repository for anything that i want to save or note down, it is the knowledge base for this agent that we need to build together continuously. 



> C:\\claude\_home\\obsidian\_ai-vault


So I have a lot of I have a lot of documents on Onedrive that are from starting in 2017 trials from every area of the business and I have a lot of folders google Drive from projects that my interns my past interns have done so I have a lot on sustainability research and planning for Road to Radical Fitness which is like a plan to make the brand super sustainable and I have a lot of content from an intern who's done a ton of marketing research Everything from competitor analysis target audience analysis Everything to do with like social media marketing looking for trending content content strategy and ideas mockups and then who else I have a lot of video footage of the development I've been filming for since 2022 and I have terabytes of behind the scenes footage from every part of the process from when I decided to make this generation and had no idea what it was going to be into its whole launch and that is a giant resource for storytelling and going to be sprinkled into the experiment journey and teasers throughout social media I have a lot of chat with chat GBT and it has a ton of memories that I can extract I have a lot of notebooks that a lot of visual ideas a lot of notes sometimes I get into a phase where I just switch to notebook and it's hard to keep up with the ideas like it's just kind of sketching through my mind but I would love to capture those I have years of notebooks I have years of workflowing notes that I can extract Let's leave it at that for now, might have more.
