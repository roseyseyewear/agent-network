# The Experiment - User Journey & Funnel Design

## Core Concept
An interactive experience where users engage with the concept of "rose-colored perception" through hypothesis sharing, lab discovery, and progressive weekly content.

## User Journey Map

### Entry Point: Landing Page
**Message**: "The Experiment"
**Action**: Share Your Hypothesis
**Goal**: Capture user engagement and entry into the experience

### Stage 1: Hypothesis Collection
- **Prompt**: User shares their hypothesis about perception/reality
- **Collection**: Store hypothesis for potential future personalization
- **Transition**: "Welcome to the Lab" reveal

### Stage 2: Lab Discovery
- **Experience**: User discovers the research lab environment
- **Introduction**: Context about rose-colored perception research
- **Connection**: Link to ROSEYS products as "research tools"
- **Weekly Hook**: "New sections of the lab open each week"

### Stage 3: Weekly Engagement
- **Cadence**: New lab sections unlock with each product drop
- **Content**: "Lost tape" archive releases tell ongoing story
- **Participation**: Multiple ways to engage beyond purchasing
- **Progression**: Story unfolds gradually, building intrigue

## User Profile System

### New Users
- **Flow**: Hypothesis → Lab Discovery → Weekly Return Prompts
- **Data**: Capture entry date, hypothesis, engagement level
- **Goal**: Guide through full initial experience

### Returning Users
- **Access**: "Back door" entry that bypasses initial setup
- **Profile**: Save progress, preferences, engagement history
- **Personalization**: Tailored content based on previous interactions
- **Loyalty**: Enhanced features for product owners
