- `agent_feedback_report.json` - Automated feedback analysis
- `task_monitoring_config.json` - System monitoring configuration

## Key Insights & Decisions

### Task Distribution Analysis
- **Total Tasks**: 93 (41 active, 52 completed)
- **Completion Rate**: 55.9%
- **Urgent Tasks**: Multiple high-priority items in progress
- **Status Distribution**: Tasks spread across in-progress, review, ready-for-work, pending, and backlog

### Agent Specialization Strategy
1. **Research Agent** (16 suitable tasks) - Highest automation value
2. **Calendar Agent** (10 suitable tasks) - High scheduling automation
3. **Email Agent** (8 suitable tasks) - Medium automation with oversight
4. **Business Agent** (Roseys/Luna Wild tasks) - Strategic business coordination
5. **Admin Agent** (Insurance/legal tasks) - Administrative automation

### Automation Opportunities
- **24+ hour stuck task detection** - Automated escalation system
- **Priority task monitoring** - 4-hour check intervals for urgent items
- **Intelligent delegation** - Keyword-based task routing to appropriate agents
- **Progress tracking** - Real-time status monitoring and feedback

## Technical Challenges Solved

### Unicode Encoding Issues
- **Problem**: Windows console couldn't display Unicode characters (emojis)
- **Solution**: Implemented fallback text markers and try-catch error handling

### Data Structure Consistency
- **Problem**: Inconsistent task data structures between API calls
- **Solution**: Added type checking and safe data access patterns

### Task Prioritization Logic
- **Problem**: Complex priority mapping from ClickUp priority system
- **Solution**: Created comprehensive priority mapping with fallback defaults

### Interactive Session Design
- **Problem**: Need for human input while maintaining automation
- **Solution**: Designed conversational interface with structured questions and response handling
