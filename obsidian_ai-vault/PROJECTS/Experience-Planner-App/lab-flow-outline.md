# Lab Flow Outline - 4-Hour Development Plan

## Lab Flow Structure

**🚪 Find The Lab Button** → Lab Entrance

**🔬 Lab Entrance**
- **Copy:** "To enter The Lab, we need to know: Have you ever worn rose-colored glasses?"
- **CTA:** "Yes, I have / No, I haven't / I'm curious what they are"
- **Branch:** All lead to Lab Atrium

**🏛️ Lab Atrium**
- **Copy:** "Welcome to The Lab, Visitor. What brings you here today?"
- **CTA:** "Research Room / Visitor Tour"
- **Branch:** Split to Research Room or Visitor Tour

## Path A: Visitor Tour

**📹 Continued Chat Experience**
- Show cool Midjourney laboratory room videos while chatting
- **Copy:** Progressive questions to learn about user while "touring"
- **Videos:** Cycle through different lab environments
- **Flow:** 3-4 chat exchanges with different lab room videos
- **End:** Return to Atrium or Exit to Shop

## Path B: Research Room

**🔬 Interactive Lab Space**
- **Observatory:** "🔒 Participants Only - Observatory Access Locked"
- **Work Bench:** Film projector with Alpha/Beta/Delta slideshows
- **Notebook:** Specifications and frame exploration (existing website content)
- **Filing Cabinet:** "🔒 Lab Notes - Access Restricted"

## Content Strategy

- **Entrance:** Simple 3-option question
- **Atrium:** Basic welcome + path choice
- **Tour:** Use existing chat system + new Midjourney lab videos
- **Research:** 4 interactive elements (2 locked, 2 accessible)

## Technical Implementation

- Leverage existing chat interface for tour
- Use existing video system for lab environments
- Simple locked/unlocked states for restricted content
- Reuse experiment level structure
