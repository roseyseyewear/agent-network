# ROSEYS Lab Experience V1 - 4 Hour Development Summary

## Overview
Minimal viable lab extension for the existing MindJourney Replit prototype, designed to be built and deployed within 4 hours using existing infrastructure.

## Current Assets Available
- âœ… **"Find The Lab" button already exists** (just needs implementation)
- âœ… **Complete video infrastructure** with player controls
- âœ… **Chat system** for interactive conversations
- âœ… **Database schema** supports branching logic
- âœ… **Existing videos** can be repurposed as lab environments
- âœ… **Website content** ready for research materials

## User Flow Architecture

### **Entry Point**
- **Find The Lab** button (already built) â†’ Lab experience

### **Core Flow**
1. **Lab Entrance** - Rose-colored glasses question (3 options, all lead to same place)
2. **Lab Atrium** - Welcome + path choice: Research Room or Visitor Tour

### **Path A: Visitor Tour**
- **3 progressive chat interactions** while "touring" through different Midjourney lab rooms
- Questions collect user insights while showing cool lab environments
- **End:** Return to atrium or exit to shop

### **Path B: Research Room** 
- **4 interactive stations:**
  - **Observatory** - ðŸ”’ Participants Only (locked)
  - **Work Bench** - Film projector with Alpha/Beta/Delta slideshows
  - **Notebook** - Specifications and frame details (existing website content)
  - **Filing Cabinet** - ðŸ”’ Lab Notes (locked for future content)

## Technical Implementation Strategy

### **Leverage Existing Infrastructure**
- Hook "Find The Lab" button to new lab navigation
- Reuse chat interface for visitor tour interactions  
- Use existing video system for lab environments
- Implement locked/unlocked states for restricted content
- Repurpose existing videos as lab atmospherics

### **New Assets Required**
- **3 Midjourney lab room videos** for visitor tour
- **Lab entrance/atrium environment videos**
- **Projector slideshow animations** using existing timeline content

### **Content Strategy**
- **Research materials:** Pull from existing website content
- **Timeline slideshows:** Use existing Alpha/Beta/Delta content  
- **Tour questions:** Progressive user profiling while exploring
- **Locked content:** Create upgrade paths to full participation

## Development Timeline (4 Hours)

**Hour 1: Core Navigation**
- Implement lab navigation system
- Hook existing "Find The Lab" button
- Create basic room-to-room movement

**Hour 2: Visitor Tour Path**
- Integrate chat system with lab tour flow
- Add Midjourney lab environment videos
- Program progressive question sequence

**Hour 3: Research Room Interactive Elements**
- Build 4 station interface with locked/unlocked states
- Implement projector slideshow system
- Add existing website content to notebook section

**Hour 4: Testing & Polish**
- Test complete user flows
- Fix navigation and branching issues
- Polish transitions and user experience

## Key Features

### **Visitor Engagement**
- **Progressive profiling** through tour conversations
- **Visual storytelling** with custom lab environments
- **Choice-driven exploration** between tour and research paths

### **Content Monetization**
- **Locked Observatory** requires full participation
- **Restricted lab notes** for future premium content
- **Upgrade paths** to full experiment participation

### **Technical Scalability**
- Built on existing robust infrastructure
- Database supports easy content additions
- Modular design allows incremental feature drops

## Success Metrics for V1
- **User engagement:** Time spent in lab vs. immediate shop exit
- **Path preference:** Tour vs. Research room selection rates
- **Conversion:** Lab visitors who upgrade to full participation
- **Content interaction:** Which research stations get most engagement

## Future Expansion Opportunities
- Unlock Observatory with advanced features
- Add more interactive lab stations
- Expand visitor tour with additional rooms
- Create participant-only premium content areas
- Build multiplayer lab exploration features
