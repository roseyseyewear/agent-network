## ‚úÖ **MAJOR ACCOMPLISHMENTS**

### **1. Strategic Planning Revision** 
- **Ultra-strategic ROSEYS launch plan** developed based on comprehensive feedback
- **Product-first approach** established (not experience-first)
- **60% automation target** (not 90%) with founder creative control
- **Quality gates** requiring 100% founder approval on customer-facing content

- **Hannah meeting transcript analyzed** and incorporated
- **Content strategy gaps identified** for founder development
- **Klaviyo integration context** documented from Otter transcript

### **3. Brand Voice & Agent Standards Established**
- **Voice by content type:** Vintage frames (scientific/founder), ZEISS (The Experiment factual), Lab references (mysterious founder)
- **Critical restrictions defined:** No visual effects shown, no marketing jargon, facts speak for themselves
- **95% brand consistency threshold** established with feedback loop system
- **Agent quality standards** for frame designer "lore" research

## üìã **KEY DECISIONS MADE**

### **Content Strategy:**
- **Single @roseys_eyewear channel** (no separate Lab account until proven)
- **"Share Your Hypothesis" as only new subscriber entry point** (no separate welcome series)
- **List warm-up starts with** "Where in the world is ROSEYS Eyewear?"
- **Frame research focus:** Designer lore and collectible value, not full biographies

### **Automation Boundaries:**
- **Psychology research postponed** - Hold for lab/email funnel background only
- **Color science research skipped** - Reserved for specialized content
- **ZEISS content limited** to product page facts (requires their review)
- **Visual content emphasis** - Let visuals stand alone, minimal captions

### **Quality Control:**
- **Human approval gate** on all customer-facing content
- **Brand consistency scoring** with continuous optimization
- **Feedback loop system** for agent improvement
- **Emergency rollback** capabilities for all automated systems

## üéØ **IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS IDENTIFIED**

### **For Founder (Tomorrow):**
1. **Complete The Experiment flow** - Replit "Share Your Hypothesis" integration (4-6 hours)
2. **Launch Frame Research Agent** - Designer lore for frames #001-010
3. **Define missing email sequences** - Warm-up content beyond "Where in the world"

### **Agent Tasks Ready to Launch:**
- **Frame Research Agent:** Extract designer lore and collectible insights
- **Content Generation Agent:** Social media post variations with founder selection
- **Visual Content Agent:** Midjourney archive organization and caption suggestions

### **Access Needed:**
- **GitHub:** Website content, fonts, product data structure
