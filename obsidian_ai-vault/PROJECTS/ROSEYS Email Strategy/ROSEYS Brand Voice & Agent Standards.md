# ROSEYS Brand Voice & Agent Standards

**Created:** August 4, 2025  
**Purpose:** Define voice consistency and agent quality thresholds

---

## ðŸŽ¯ **BRAND VOICE BY CONTENT TYPE**

### **Vintage Frames** 
**Voice:** Scientific fact OR Founder (agent choice)
**Focus:** Extract designer "lore" and intrigue
- What made them rise to fame, unique, risky
- Target customer persona for that style/era
- Few poignant words that true collectors appreciate
- Quality from past vs today's approach (never say "fast fashion")
- Let facts showcase past craftsmanship and design process
- Make obvious that vintage/past generations worthy of investing in now

### **ZEISS Partnership & Science**
**Voice:** The Experiment (British, curious, factual)
**Standards:**
- Strictly what's on product page (requires ZEISS review)
- Very factual, no marketing jargon or superlatives
- The facts speak for themselves
- No overpromising or unsubstantiated claims

### **Mysterious Lab References**
**Voice:** The Founder (busy, mysterious)
**Content Categories:**
- **Lab oriented:** Cool lab settings, futuristic equipment analyzing roses/eyes
- **Observation:** People with sleeping masks/rose colored glasses
- **Fake news style:** Giant origami roses on Thames, crowds in rain with masks, news reporters asking "what do you see?"
**Captions:** "View from the lab", "Another day at the lab", "Now accepting hypotheses at the lab"

## ðŸš« **CRITICAL RESTRICTIONS**

### **Never Do:**
- Show visual effect of the glasses or talk about it
- Imply results beyond generic remarks like "wow"
- Use marketing jargon or superlatives
- Overtell designer stories (hint, don't take responsibility)
- Say "fast fashion"
- Force captions when visuals stand alone

### **Always Do:**
- Keep to tight set of chosen words
- Simple, factual, non-marketing content
- Less is more approach
- Let visuals stand for themselves
- No caption better than forced caption

1. **Voice accuracy** for content type
2. **Factual accuracy** about frames/science

### **Research Detail Levels:**
