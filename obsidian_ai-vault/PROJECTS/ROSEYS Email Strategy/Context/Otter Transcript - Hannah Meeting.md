## FULL TRANSCRIPT

Bethany Rose Cannon  0:00  
But, yeah, just been getting ready for a trip. I'm excited to leave this afternoon. How have you been? How's your morning?

Hannah Williams  0:07  
Good? Yeah, I am. I went to the gym early this morning, and then I came back. I did some work for the other company that I work for, and I'm just logging on to do your work. So, yeah, it was productive. It was good, awesome. Nice. I always like, hate going to the gym first thing, but then I always feel better after going first thing in the morning. It like set you off, well for the day.

Bethany Rose Cannon  0:30  
Yes, exactly, Jared and I are trying to get into that together at the same time. And like, I

Unknown Speaker  0:45  
to work out,

Hannah Williams  0:51  
oh, that the audio is really I can't hear what you're saying. It's very crackly. Hang on. That you

Bethany Rose Cannon  1:25  
Hello, hello, hi. Can you hear me better? Oh, yeah,

Hannah Williams  1:29  
you were like, a bit like a robot before.

Bethany Rose Cannon  1:33  
That's funny. I am just moved to the we have like a little music stand right by our router. So Okay, close as I can be to the internet now, awesome. All right, but yeah, I you inspired me to read before I go to sleep, which has been working out. So maybe you'll inspire me to go to the gym in the morning.

Hannah Williams  1:57  
Yeah, has it helped with you getting to sleep like better,

Bethany Rose Cannon  2:01  
yeah, yeah, I've been and I've been wanting to, like, have my devices kind of just like, located in one area, like by our computer, so I'm not, like, always charging them by My bed. And, you know, Just like Feeling Like you

Unknown Speaker  3:23  
Hello, You.

Speaker 1  4:38  
You. Hello, Hi,

Bethany Rose Cannon  4:42  
oh, man, feel like I'm in 1995 do I say robot? What's going on? No, I my internet just completely cut out. It's the weirdest thing. It says I have internet access now I exit out of all my other browsers because I had all these crazy AI things running. So I'm like, maybe I'm using up too much of the internet, but it should be, like,

Hannah Williams  5:05  
it should be That's so weird. You know what? I find internet in the UK just isn't great in general, really. Is it just something we need to

Bethany Rose Cannon  5:13  
cope with? It's just

Hannah Williams  5:15  
like, my phone signal is awful where I live. I'm like, why can't I get you know, we're not like, living in the middle of nowhere. I just don't get it,

Bethany Rose Cannon  5:24  
yeah? It's wild. It's like, it's a small land mass. It's not like you have to cover much ground, yeah? Well, okay, so I think I had got you set up with a Klaviyo account as a user at one point, I forget what we did in there, but they think we did. No, okay, I'll go on and see if I can add you. I thought we did something in here, but I don't remember it was,

Hannah Williams  5:53  
let's have a look. I've

Bethany Rose Cannon  5:57  
probably signed you on to slow so many different platforms that I can't Yeah, I'll text, I'll send you the website here.

Hannah Williams  6:06  
No, I definitely don't recognize this, okay? And she did, and I didn't sign up to it.

Bethany Rose Cannon  6:14  
Yeah, it's basically a platform that you pay to kind of manage your emails, so like the different lists that you can have and different campaigns. And you can kind of automate emails that go out, so you don't have to, like, be sending them at that time. So you kind of can build like flows where you're like, okay, like, once a week I want to send an email, and you can kind of like, load them all in and it will automatically send. And you can get really fancy, like, you can segment, oh, I didn't add my little otter in, but anyways, I'm happy to tell you this all again. Oh, you do. Oh, cool. Okay, I wasn't sure if it left with me. Yeah, you could segment, like the different audiences here, I'll just share my screen real quick, and then I'll do the setup with you.

Unknown Speaker  7:04  
Let's see, how do I share? Okay,

Hannah Williams  7:14  
yeah,

Speaker 1  7:16  
okay, yeah, so this is like

Bethany Rose Cannon  7:22  
i Okay, well, I just, I would love for you to, like, get oriented and to the campaigns that we have set up already and what we need to decide on. Did you have a question? No,

Hannah Williams  7:38  
I was just gonna say these set up to go out, or they've already been done.

Speaker 1  7:43  
What is this one? Live? Welcome. Let's

Bethany Rose Cannon  7:50  
do it. Let's just see this one says it's live. So I'm curious to see, I don't think I have like, an email open, right one?

Unknown Speaker  7:59  
Okay, interesting.

Bethany Rose Cannon  8:06  
Okay, this is like, I don't have any campaigns live. I'm putting this into draft, so I haven't been running any traffic to my website, like any marketing or anything so, and I've been trying to, at first, I, like, released the whole collection. I think I told you I was, like, just like, early access. Here's all my products, because there's a bunch of people who have been waiting for them, and like, I was getting some traffic, so I just launched them all, and then I didn't spend a lot of time into, like, the whole process of, like, it's called, like, nurturing leads. So leads are, like, somebody who like potentially buy your product, and they need to kind of have that, like, those touch points with the brand in order to learn more, to decide if they want to buy what you're selling. And so what the I've been trying to kind of like, decide on what that process will be like. And I think I have a pretty good idea. And I think what we'll do is we'll set up like, oh, actually, I wrote it down on my whatsapp, let me see. So we'll set up a welcome series. So that's like, if somebody signs up on the website, they will like, put their email in to like, be on our newsletter, or whatever they think they're signing up for, they'll get like, a series of emails that automatically get sent out. So like, one would be like, right away, and then the next one might be, like, a week later. And it goes on for like, a couple weeks, and they kind of get introduced to, like, the core concepts of, you know, what you're trying to sell, and then, so that's like one campaign is like, welcome series. And I think you'll see here on my screen, I have some of them built out already. I think this might have been what my intern did, yeah, but I wanted to just, I guess I'll just open it up and take a look. So I'll, I can show you how it kind of works. So when you create a campaign on that previous page, you can kind of set up, like the logic. So the welcome series is like, when someone is added to the email list, then what happens? And so, yeah, this is, I think, what he had, that maybe conditional split, Okay, interesting. This didn't really go very far, but what we'll want to do, maybe, what should I do? I think I should just like, I think I'll just have you build out, like, the logic, and we'll worry about what goes in the actual email later, once I've, like, finalized my website, but we need to set it up so that. Okay, let me just sketch this out on a piece of paper real quick.

Hannah Williams  10:59  
Take notes as well. Just okay.

Bethany Rose Cannon  11:03  
So I think we want to do

Unknown Speaker  11:11  
okay so we have welcome series. Let me

Bethany Rose Cannon  11:17  
check in my other one and just make sure I'm not reinventing the wheel before I try to write this out, maybe interaction email three days before lunch and weekends. Okay, we put some of this in. It's like every three days. So this is day one, and then

Speaker 1  11:36  
there's some conditional split. Let's say what this is. Say sometimes, okay, okay. This is just like, let me click back to this. Other examples here. Welcome series test, okay.

Bethany Rose Cannon  12:00  
This is the one that he had sent to himself to make sure that the platform is sending

Unknown Speaker  12:07  
welcome email.

Bethany Rose Cannon  12:09  
Okay, this is just a test, so I think I'm just gonna delete this. Sorry. I'm trying to, like, get re acclimated to this whole thing. So maybe it's just helpful, at least for you to see,

Hannah Williams  12:19  
handy to watch, yes,

Speaker 1  12:26  
okay, let's see. Just clear this out.

Speaker 1  12:38  
Okay, past customer, subscriber, story campaign.

Bethany Rose Cannon  12:49  
Okay, maybe this is the one that he had set helped set up. I don't know if I want to do it this way, but maybe this is Day Zero, day zero to zero. So that's not totally set up.

Bethany Rose Cannon  13:12  
Okay, this is just like a one email thing, all right, so we don't have anything. It seems like that is really set up for what I want to do. But I think one of these might be, like a good starting point. So I think it was a story campaign, although I don't know if that's different. Okay, so let me just talk this through. I want to do this welcome series, and then I'm also going to do like, what I'm kind of calling, like a warm up, like, list warm up, I guess, which is getting back in my current lists inbox and kind of re establishing, like, Hey, this is where we've been. This is what we're doing, type of thing. And so that maybe we'll say, let's say that's like three emails, and I'll talk to I'll figure out the actual strategy, but I just think it will help if you could set up the foundation and like the structure, and then I'll get involved with the details later, and then the welcome series, that's going to be how Uh, hello, because a tricky part is I want to send out a welcome series, but maybe I should send a welcome series. Okay, yeah, I'm trying to think of what I did for Luna Wilde. So I think what I did when I started her automated campaign was I created this new welcome series that really like leads you through the story of the brand, and then ends with some kind of like action to, like, buy the product. And then, I think, once I started that for the email sign up on the website, I sent I started that as its own. Like, I copied the entire campaign. Like, duplicated it. And then I said, instead of the trigger being when somebody signs up for email, I set the trigger as like send now to this list, and then you kind of build in those times for the next emails to be sent. So like the whole email list will get the welcome series, and then the email

Speaker 1  15:23  
list will get the same thing. So I was just

Bethany Rose Cannon  15:29  
thinking, I think before I do that, okay, so I think I'm coming up with a plan. So we'll make a welcome series my Seattle mind. Thanks for bearing with me. No, it's fine. So we'll make the welcome series, and then we'll duplicate it for the existing list.

Bethany Rose Cannon  16:01  
And we'll also make like I said, I think we'll do a list, Warm Up series.

Speaker 1  16:08  
Warm Up series. Maybe

Bethany Rose Cannon  16:11  
it's, let's just say like, one. Let's just say it's, let's just do one. I don't know how many. Actually, we'll have to ask chatgpt. Maybe you should do that. Ask chat GPT. It's been How long since I sent my last email campaign? It's been like five months since I sent any emails to my list, and so just tell chat GPT that we're planning to send out a whole new series of emails to this list, and we're going to be sending them from an, I guess, like a new, I think it's, yeah, it's like a fairly new email with, like a fairly new an old domain, but a new email. And we want to get a lot of engagement on the the series that we send out. So we're trying to create this list warm up theories to get people active, I guess, on our campaigns, and then ask it if it has a suggestion for how many emails we should do and over how much time. Yeah, does that make sense?

Hannah Williams  17:42  
That was just a lot. No, no, I'm, I've taken notes of it.

Bethany Rose Cannon  17:45  
Okay, thank you so much. So once you have an idea of that, then whatever touch you, BC, teeth has just set the logic up and Klaviyo, and I'll, I'll show you how to create, like a new one on here now, so you can see and then,

Hannah Williams  18:05  
shall I write This? Shall I ask chatgpt now?

Unknown Speaker  18:08  
Sure. Yeah. Okay, yeah.

Hannah Williams  18:35  
Okay,

Bethany Rose Cannon  18:38  
I think we'll just have I'm going to just leave these ones that are in here, because I don't have time to decide if I want to delete them or not, and then I'm going to create a new flow. So sorry, I'll just go back. Are you able to see my screen? And I can kind of show you how to create a new one. So I'll do it for the welcome series, and then you can set it up once we have the idea for the list, warm up.

Hannah Williams  19:02  
Okay, I might just, I might record just so I remember, yes, yeah, sure. Cool, okay, yeah, I'm ready. Okay,

Bethany Rose Cannon  19:15  
so this is how you set up a new flow in Klaviyo, you click, create flow. It's been a while since I've done this, and we just want to create our own, build your own. And then I'll just start all of these. We can title them 2025, and so I'll say, welcome series. And for the one that you do, it will be called list, warm up. Yeah. I don't know what this tag is, so we'll just say, create manually.

Bethany Rose Cannon  19:59  
And then for this one, we don't have to worry about select. Selecting a trigger. We'll just worry about setting up the emails,

Unknown Speaker  20:09  
oh, unless it makes us okay so just I missed.

Bethany Rose Cannon  20:25  
Okay, so it does make you select a trigger, so you can just add whatever. And then before we run it live, we'll change it.

Unknown Speaker  20:35  
Okay. So

Bethany Rose Cannon  20:38  
then what we do is like, drag in the different like notifications that we want to go out. And at first we'll just set it up for email, but I think the next step will be setting up the same thing for SMS, but we'll wait on that for now. Um, and so we have the trigger. This is the first email. Time Delay is how long the system waits until it actually sends it out. So I think for this one, we'll just have no time delay. It'll go right away, but we'll put a time delay in, and maybe you could chat with chat GPT for the warm up on that, like how much time in between each email? So that's where you'll set this here for the welcome email. Let's say I think I've done maybe you could ask chatgpt about this too. I think I talked to another founder who had a series of emails. I'd have to go find his notes. But it was something like, within two weeks, he sends out a series of, can't remember what it was. It felt like it was like five emails that go through, like the different touch, the different value points of his product, and then he got, he was always driving towards, like, raising the percentage that he was able to, like, get sales from that strategy. So I think it was around there. But yeah, maybe you could just talk with chatgpt about that and then build out what you think, and then I'll be working on, like, the content side of it. Okay, in the meantime. And if it's easy enough to just, like, set this up for both of these. Want the both of these campaigns, like the list warm up and the welcome series, yeah, you could look at how we could then, like, a SMS as well. Like, I think we might have to, I don't know, maybe it's something we should ask chatgpt how the best way is to do it, because I'm trying to see if, yeah, I don't think we can add both to the same flow. But, or maybe because this is added. The trigger is added to email list, but we want it

Hannah Williams  23:08  
to be SMS as well. Okay, I'll ask chat GPT as well about that. Okay,

Bethany Rose Cannon  23:12  
because it might be we that we could add it in here, in the same flow, which would be preferred, or that we have to, that we should fill all the content out for this campaign, like, what's all the text going to say, and then duplicate it and edit it for like, SMS, okay, so, yeah, find out about that, and then do whatever makes sense, if there's anything to set up. If not, we can wait. So I think that's the gist of setting up the flow. It's drag and drop. It seems straight forward. Yeah, okay, cool, yeah. So then I guess you had this. I don't know what update status means. Let's see preview flow.

Unknown Speaker  23:58  
Okay.

Bethany Rose Cannon  24:01  
Flow Status, okay, we want to keep these in draft. I don't know what Oh, update status must be whether or not it's live, so I think it just saves automatically, and then you can just exit out. So cool. Yeah. And then let me pull up my whatsapp real quick and see,

Hannah Williams  24:26  
shall I do both the warm up list and the welcome series? Then,

Bethany Rose Cannon  24:29  
yes, that would be great. That's fine. So welcome, automation, email, warm up, lab contacts. These are all tasks for later, review emails on methods, okay, yeah, these are all tasks for later. So I'll pull those into clickup so I don't forget. But if you could just focus on this, then hopefully by the time, maybe like tomorrow, I'll have content that we can I can give to you, maybe, like a Google Doc or something, and then you can help me, like, kind of set up, like the formatting, like how the emails look, and like setting up the different like text and images that need to go in them. If that makes sense.

Hannah Williams  25:18  
I'm just looking now. I sent you a note about, like, just a suggestion about from chat GBT. Do you just want me to do the number of emails that they recommend? Or do you want me to also do like, the email, email type that they recommend as well? Oh, let's see. This was just a rough draft that they sent over. Okay,

Bethany Rose Cannon  25:43  
cool. I love that we can have somebody working for us as we're talking about. Okay, so day okay. So day one, engage users, engage plus recent clicks.

Unknown Speaker  25:58  
Just yeah,

Bethany Rose Cannon  26:05  
you don't have to put the content in, but

Hannah Williams  26:09  
you'll do the content just the days.

Bethany Rose Cannon  26:11  
Yeah, just the day and the timing.

Speaker 1  26:15  
I'll engage some dormant I'm just trying to read through it so so often it's okay, yeah,

Bethany Rose Cannon  26:26  
but I like these ideas, so maybe if you could pull these into, like a click up task, yeah, that will help prompts when I'm ready to fill up the content ideas,

Hannah Williams  26:40  
when Do you happy? Did you say this week, I

Bethany Rose Cannon  26:43  
really want to launch as soon as possible. So, like, I just keep running up against, like, all these problems, like trying to get my website in that like, a good place to spend traffic to and like, test but I keep thinking that it will happen, and I'm just waiting for the day. So any day now, hopefully, I don't know it's just so hard for me to with some things that I've never done before, to know how long it's going to take. But really would love to launch, like, at least, I would really love to launch something like, just put the website live in some version that I have it and re engage with my audience while I'm in Paris, because that would be, like a dream, like it would be so cool, like Levy and Rose, and I'm, like, launching my first, like, big campaign, and just feel so magical. And I really want to do it while I'm there, hopefully by Thursday, but we'll see how it goes. See it. Thank you. Yeah, I'm really excited. Maybe tomorrow, once we talk about, like, building the content. Wait, sorry, do you have availability sometime tomorrow to chat?

Hannah Williams  27:52  
Today, I'm more limited on time, but tomorrow I have, like, a lot more availability. So what sort of time would you like to meet? I can send over a Google invite.

Bethany Rose Cannon  28:00  
Okay, yeah. Let's plan to meet maybe with, like, one o'clock your time work. That's fine. I think I'm an hour ahead, so that would be like two for me. Awesome. Okay, and yeah, hopefully by by then, I'll be like, very confident in my my flow, my customer journey that I'm like doing on the website, and then we can, I'd love to share that with you, get your feedback, because all I have is chat to beachy and Jared right now. But I'd love to see what you think. And then I think a lot of the content that is, I'm planning for the website. We can kind of just like, adapt for, like, pretty brief emails to, like, get people curious enough to click. So we'll plan to do that tomorrow. And, yeah, I think that's, I think that's my first priority tomorrow. And then any of these other tasks can be, like, a later thing.

Hannah Williams  29:00  
Okay, oh, super exciting. I'm excited for you

Bethany Rose Cannon  29:04  
cool. Yeah, I'm excited that you can help me. Honestly, it's like, so nice to have somebody reliable and, like, smart and just like, I know she can do this, you know, like, I've been trying to do this stuff for so long by myself, and I've had so many people help, like my interns, really helpful. But sometimes I just feel like, so overwhelmed and like I can't do enough fast enough. So it's been, like, totally expediting this whole process, and I'm really grateful. Oh

Hannah Williams  29:31  
no, I love it. No, I'm totally on board with it. Also it's going, Oh yeah, awesome.

Bethany Rose Cannon  29:38  
Well, let me know if you need any input on getting into Oh, actually, yeah, let me, let me see. Let me go and to see if there's an invite. Um,

Hannah Williams  30:03  
uh, users,

Bethany Rose Cannon  30:06  
oh, it was, um, all tough that I remember adding in recently. That's why add a user.

Bethany Rose Cannon  30:20  
It's outlook.com, right, yes,

Unknown Speaker  30:23  
okay,

Bethany Rose Cannon  30:28  
I just sent it so you should be seeing an email.

Hannah Williams  30:37  
Yes, it's just come through account setup.

Hannah Williams  30:45  
Why is that's not working, okay?

Bethany Rose Cannon  30:58  
Oh, that's what we could do tomorrow. I'm gonna let me I'm gonna make a click up task with like, backlog things for the launch, because I keep thinking of things, but I'll just note it down here so I don't an

Hannah Williams  31:15  
error save. I Is

Bethany Rose Cannon  31:24  
it giving you trouble getting in?

Hannah Williams  31:26  
Yeah, I'm just asking for my number, a second, oh, 737-712-9234, confirm number and send code. I

Hannah Williams  31:56  
um, I'm just texting Bohus, the chef, as we as we're talking, I'm going to send you over the cost for this week. Oh, great. Thank you. He said he missed out two burritos, but he's typing, oh yeah,

Bethany Rose Cannon  32:11  
I meant to text you about that. I wasn't sure if I forgot to order them or if he forgot them.

Hannah Williams  32:15  
He's just, he said I missed out two burritos, and he's just typing, 771, 895, I

Hannah Williams  32:24  
71 895, exit, okay,

Hannah Williams  32:40  
I believe I'm on it, but am I linked to yours?

Bethany Rose Cannon  32:46  
Yes, you should see. You should be

Unknown Speaker  32:48  
able to go to flows.

Hannah Williams  32:51  
Yeah, I can see, okay, yeah, I am

Bethany Rose Cannon  32:54  
okay. And just out of curiosity, are you able, if you click on audience and just lists, are you able to see that

Hannah Williams  33:02  
data if I click on audience and lists, yes, I've got that too.

Bethany Rose Cannon  33:10  
Okay? And if you click on email list, does that come up for you? List

Hannah Williams  33:14  
and segments? Email List is, should that be on the side?

Bethany Rose Cannon  33:22  
It's on like, the main screen. If you click Lists and segments, it says email list with like a star, a gold star.

Hannah Williams  33:29  
Yes, I've got that too. Okay,

Bethany Rose Cannon  33:31  
and if you click that, are you able to see all the yes, okay, cool. All right, we might do something with the audiences before we launch, so I'm going to put that on my backlog to talk about later. I just want to make sure you have access cool. Do you have any questions now that you're in here? No,

Hannah Williams  33:53  
I think I'll just Yeah, no, I think it's pretty straightforward. I'll go ahead with chat GBT and get that done now. Okay, I wish I could

Bethany Rose Cannon  34:02  
share my chat GPT that knows about roses with you. So because I'm gonna look I saw like, some notification about like sharing like context with people. So maybe there's some way for me to do that.

Hannah Williams  34:18  
It already has, like, a background,

Bethany Rose Cannon  34:20  
yeah, it's been, like, my business partner, it's like, it knows like, more about what I'm doing than I do.

Hannah Williams  34:28  
Yeah, that would be good. Okay,

Bethany Rose Cannon  34:29  
okay, well, let me know how that goes. And yeah, when you ask chatgpt about the welcome series as well, like, if you want to just ask it for, like, generic advice on, like, how to structure the welcome series, just so we have some like, inspiration tomorrow, that would be great. Okay,

Hannah Williams  34:47  
I made a task on clickup, but I've not put anything into it yet. So I can, like, we can add subtasks on that. Okay, cool.

Bethany Rose Cannon  34:54  
Sounds good. Thank you so much. And, yeah, I think this takes, like, the priority currently, and then let me know, like when you're done, and I might have other priority things over, like our personal stuff this next couple days.

Hannah Williams  35:09  
That's fine. Okay, I'll let you know when I'm done.

Bethany Rose Cannon  35:11  
Okay, cool. Thanks so much. Hannah, you
