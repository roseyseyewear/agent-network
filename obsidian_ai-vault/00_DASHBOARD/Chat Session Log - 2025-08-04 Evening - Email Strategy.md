**Session Focus:** ROSEYS Email Strategy Development & Brand Voice Framework  
**Duration:** Extended strategic planning session  
**Outcome:** Complete email strategy framework and agent standards established

---

## **Session Overview**

**Primary Objective:** Develop ROSEYS content strategy focusing on @roseys_eyewear channel and email automation flows

**Key Participants:** Founder + Claude, with Hannah Assistant context from Otter transcript analysis

**Major Deliverables:**
- ROSEYS Email Strategy framework
- Brand Voice & Agent Standards document  
- Agent research task preparation
- Git commit of all strategic work

---

## **Strategic Evolution**

### **Initial Request:**
- Content pillars for launch and posting schedule
- Email schedule for list warmup
- "Share Your Hypothesis" signup flow
- Focus on @roseys_eyewear only (no separate Lab profile until proven)

### **Discovery Process:**
1. **Found existing warmup sequence** in temp_2025_content_plan.txt starting with "Where in the world is ROSEYS Eyewear?"
2. **Located ClickUp task** "Roseys Launch Backlog" with Otter.ai recording of Hannah meeting
3. **Analyzed comprehensive Hannah meeting transcript** for email strategy context
4. **Extracted existing 2025 content plan elements** including three-voice strategy

### **Key Insight:**
Founder already had substantial strategy developed - needed organization and integration, not creation from scratch

---

## **Email Strategy Framework Established**

### **Flow Structure Clarified:**
1. **List Warm-up Series** - Existing subscribers (5-month gap), starts with "Where in the world is ROSEYS Eyewear?"
2. **"Share Your Hypothesis" Welcome Flow** - ALL new subscribers (only entry point, no separate welcome series)
3. **Experiment Completion Flow** - Participants who complete full experiment

### **Content Strategy Integration:**
- **From 2025 plan:** Three voices (Experiment - British/curious, Founder - busy/mysterious, Observer - neutral)
- **From Hannah meeting:** Brand story → product value → purchase action progression
- **Warmup approach:** "Where we've been, what we're doing" re-engagement

---

## **Brand Voice Framework Development**

### **Content Type Voice Assignments:**
- **Vintage Frames:** Scientific fact OR Founder voice (agent choice)
- **ZEISS Partnership/Science:** The Experiment voice (factual, no marketing jargon)
- **Mysterious Lab References:** The Founder voice (busy, mysterious)

### **Lab Content Categories Defined:**
- **Lab-oriented:** Cool settings, futuristic equipment analyzing roses/eyes
- **Observation:** People with sleeping masks/rose colored glasses  
- **Fake news style:** Giant origami roses on Thames, crowds with masks in rain

### **Critical Restrictions Established:**
- Never show visual effect of glasses or talk about it
- No marketing jargon or superlatives - facts speak for themselves
- No overpromising beyond generic remarks like "wow"
- Let visuals stand alone - no caption better than forced caption

---

## **Agent Standards & Quality Control**

### **95% Brand Consistency Threshold:**
1. Voice accuracy for content type
2. Factual accuracy about frames/science  
3. Visual brand standards compliance
4. No overpromising on experiment results
5. Adherence to all restrictions

### **Research Detail Levels:**
- **Frame Designer Research:** Extract "lore" and intrigue, not full biography
- **Focus:** What made them rise to fame, unique, risky
- **Audience:** True collectors who appreciate poignant insights
- **Quality:** Past craftsmanship vs today's approach (never say "fast fashion")

### **Feedback Loop System:**
- Agent produces → Founder reviews → Feedback captured → Parameters updated
- Continuous optimization with network improvement proposals
- Emergency rollback capabilities for all systems

---

## **Technical Integration Context**

### **From Hannah Meeting Analysis:**
- **Klaviyo platform** setup with Hannah having access
- **5-month email silence** requiring careful re-engagement strategy
- **Duplicate strategy approach:** Create welcome series, duplicate for existing list
- **Target launch:** Thursday while in Paris for emotional significance

### **Content Development Workflow:**
- **Division of labor:** Hannah technical setup, Bethany content creation
- **Source material:** Adapt website content for brief, curiosity-driving emails
- **Format:** Short, action-oriented emails that drive clicks to website

---

## **Access Requirements Identified**

### **For Full Agent Implementation:**
- **GitHub access:** Website content, fonts, product data structure, tight word set
- **Shopify access (if needed):** Product listings, tags, high-quality images, designer/decade data
- **ZEISS resources:** Approved materials for factual content (requires their review)

### **Research Tasks Ready:**
- **Frame Research Agent:** Designer lore for frames #001-010
- **Content Generation Agent:** Social media variations with founder selection
- **Visual Content Agent:** Midjourney archive organization and minimal captions

---

## **Strategic Decisions Made**

### **Content Approach:**
- Single @roseys_eyewear channel (no Lab separation until proven)
- "Share Your Hypothesis" as only new subscriber entry point
- Psychology research postponed (lab/email funnel background only)
- Color science research skipped (reserved for specialized content)

### **Quality Over Speed:**
- Human approval gate on all customer-facing content
- Brand consistency scoring with continuous optimization
- Manual fallback procedures for every automated system
- 60% automation target (not 90%) preserving founder creative control

---
