I recently tested my rose-colored glasses brand on the market successfully and am getting ready to launch a full line of products in a small quantity. My primary source of customers is from instagram connected to my shopify website.

I'm looking for an adviser to help review and finalize my budgets, pricing strategy, reinvestment, customer acquisition cost, customer lifetime value, and scaling plan. I have started to develop these in a spreadsheet along with my costs and overhead expenses with guidance from online resources and the help of an intern but I'm looking for someone with fashion industry experience to make sure I'm starting off right. I'm also looking for guidance on how to set up a good book keeping workflow and how to forecast and set sales goals.

About Roseys I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve heard the saying take off your rose colored glasses, right? Right, it means you‚Äôre being too optimistic . Well I know a lot of young people , including myself, struggle with th is pessimistic judgmental view that can really darken our experience of the world and the world‚Äôs experience of us so I created Roseys as a movement to challenge people to put on their rose colored glasses and remember that while we can‚Äôt always change what we see, we can change the lenses we look through So my rose red lenses are really meant to be this remind er that wonder and love are always just a matter of perspective , in every moment no matter where we ar e, and they do that by making the world blossom into this warm new dimension of sunse t colors that is really captivating . So Roseys i s my way of really dedicating myself to learning how to cultivate that rose colored state of mind even when the glasses come of f and I do that by exploring the nature of consciousness and compassion with my local and online communities through perspective shifting conversations, meditations, reflections, and philosophies. I‚Äôve been on this sort of incessant journey to understand how to be happy, how to find peace amidst life‚Äôs tragedies and uncertainty and I‚Äôve found a lot of ease in practicing meditation and trying to live mindfully. I really believe that so much of the world‚Äôs polarization and delusion and unnecessary suffering can be solved by simply becoming more aware of ourselves and others. Have you had any experience with meditation? I got intrigued to start this as a business because every time I would trade my red sunglasses with someone they would just be like woahhh this is amazing, I‚Äôve never seen anything like this. They would be completely captivated by seeing the world in a new way. At the same time, I was on my own incessant journey of becoming more mindful of my thoughts and emotions through studying different philosophers and practicing different types of meditation. I was learning to take control of my outlook on life and I saw so many of my friends struggling to do the same so Roseys became my way to dig deeper and share the perspective shifting insights I was finding. Growth My first one style mvp line of round retro gold frames sold out after a year of testing and became a recognizable statement piece in local yoga and techno circles , representative of its movement to see the world bloom . Right before 2020, I launched my first collection of three styles that I planned to share at outdoor events t hroughout the US and small retail shops. Since the shutdown, I‚Äôve pivoted into the digital world which has posed a lot of challenges. First collection ‚Äì broke even and sold out by 2018 Second collection ‚Äì 1/ 4 th of inventory, 5k in sales 2021 Goal: Lifestyle Brand Phase 1/2/3/4 Social media strategy Emily photos wellness guides graphics podcast clips Products graphic prints children‚Äôs book jackets option for yoga line with local Brazilian etsy shop for solar opposites + other handmade collabs Retail strategy local marketplaces/galleries for creatives local niche connect sd add others surf shops? markets with Ashley hopefully Podcast rosey hour with more locals get line up of experts and higher profile guests record launch Spotify playlists meditation playlists podcast playlists

In 2017, Bethany founded ROSEYS Eyewear - a homegrown independent boutique of red sunset blossoming sunglasses designed in San Diego to remind the world to look with love. From 2017-2018 - Developed the brand and completed prototype and market testing with ROSEYS' 1.0 Collection of round gold frames called, Major Sunsets, and a meditative practice to remind wearers how to See the World Bloom, even when the rose colored glasses come off. The collection was shared online via Instagram and Shopify and in person at outdoor events throughout San Diego. Bethany teamed up with an upcycling festival fashion designer, Solar Opposites, to repurpose defective ROSEYS' products into one of a kind wearable art pieces. The 1.0 Collection sold out in fall of 2018 and began to become a locally recognizable statement piece in the house/techno music community. In 2019, Bethany further developed the business strategy, brand, and products with the assistance of marketing intern, Danielle Carboni . That winter, ROSEYS' 2.0 Collection launched with three SoCal inspired styles, new accessories, an insightful Scroll of Rosey Wisdom, and plans to share them at festivals and curated gatherings throughout the US. As the world shut down in 2020, ROSEYS went completely digital, spreading love through perspective shifting Instagram posts and live virtual conversations with inspiring blossoms in the local community on The ROSEY Hour. That summer, ROSEYS shipped a small batch to spread the bloom across North America on Amazon's Marketplace. Visit the shop at www.roseys.love and follow the bloom on instagram @roseys_eyewear

Want to gain professional experience and explore your dreams for the future while supporting two local sustainable fashion brands dedicated to doing good ? I'm looking for multi-talented students with creative intuition and a problem-solving mentality to assist with business development and support for two growing San Diego fashion brands, Roseys Eyewear and Luna Wild Collection. Roseys Eyewear The idea for Roseys Eyewear began in 2017 with a vision to remind the world to look with love and share the wonder and perspective of San Diego sunsets through rose red lenses. Since then, it has been my mission to spread the rose-colored experience as an invitation to explore how to maintain a rosey point of view even when the glasses come off. Roseys' #SeeTheWorldBloom movement is dedicated to sharing practices that allow mindfulness and compassion to flourish while cultivating the history, science, and philosophy around human consciousness , wisdom, and wellbeing . Roseys 1 .0 and 2.0 Collections tested this concept on the market with overwhelming success, becoming a recognizable statement piece on dancefloors throughout Southern California and beyond. Since launching , they‚Äôve been caught on stage and in music videos with Tu Lengua Esta Nice, New Age Politics, and Luver Boy. This year, I am scaling up the brand and movement, pitching to investors, and designing the third generation of my rose-colored sunglasses to be a climate positive circular product line, ethically made to grow a perspective shifting revolution. ‚Äì Bethany Rose Cannon, Founder and Designer Check out Roseys latest Brand Guide here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AVs0lNZ1HrqxjD_X8Vdf9nBe77RlgBtK/view?usp=sharing Find Roseys on instagram at www.instagram.com/roseys_eyewear and learn more on our website www.roseys.lov e. Luna Wild Collection Luna Wild Collection is a luxury clothing company creating one-of-a-kind pieces ethically and sustainably handmade from upcycled saris in India. Their founder Ashley is dedicated to empowering the Indian community that empowers us with the celestial clothing they create through her partnership with Purnata, a non-profit organization committed to ending human trafficking and rehabilitating its survivors in India. Every Luna Wild piece donates 5% profits to Purnata's rehabilitation shelter in one of the red light districts of Mumbai where survivors learn skills to build a life for themselves and integrate into society. With the exception of 2020, our founder often travels to India to source saris and hire graduates of their education and tailoring training program to make pieces for the collection. Throughout the year, Luna Wild works closely with Purnata to understand their needs and host fundraisers to¬†support¬†their¬†local¬†initiatives. Since selling her first pieces at Lightning in a Bottle after her first solo trip to India in 2017, Ashley has been adorning a growing tribe including DJ‚Äôs from Ofier to Lee Reynolds. Check out Luna Wild on instagram (www.instagram.com/lunawildcollection) and website (www.lunawildcollection.com) to learn more. Roseys' founder partnered with Luna Wild in 2021 as their Ecommerce Manager and Designer to bring their successful business online and redefine the look and voice of the brand. After much success, this year, we plan to continue to automate, outsource, and scale our digital operations and expand our charitable initiatives. Responsibilities: This position will support Roseys‚Äô founder, Bethany in the development and management of Roseys and Luna Wild Collection. In the spirit of supporting your education, rather than define your responsibilities, I would love to hear from you about your ideal experience. As an entrepreneur, I believe in doing what you love and I would love for this to be your opportunity to seek that out. I am hiring two student interns to support my business development initiatives and gain firsthand experience supporting scaling startup brands in ecommerce , events, and retail . After both putting in over 4 years into growing our businesses, Ashley and I are both in a very exciting stage of expansion . From innovative brand awareness campaigns to sustainability roadmaps to building grassroots social movements , we have a diverse range of projects in 2022 that could be an opportunity for you to explore your passions. We hope this will open the door to innovative projects, outside the bounds of traditional corporate roles , unless that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre looking for :) If anything here has sparked your interest, reach out and let us know how our businesses may serve as an opportunity for you to apply what you‚Äôre studying or explore topics related to your major course of study , not otherwise covered in your school work. Experience: Any relevant experience is welcome but willingness to learn on the go and think outside the box is the most important. Term: F ull time , part time , or project based. This position will be accepting applications on a rolling basis . Compensation: This position is unpaid, applicants seeking college credits, references, and hands on experience welcome! Remote: Due to COVID-19, my internships are supported remotely. There may be some opportunity for in person collaboration but it is not required. We will have virtual meetings and communication via phone, text, email, video conferencing on a regular basis. Professional mentoring: I love supporting aspiring business owners and creatives and am always happy to help advise and brainstorm on your pursuits. Roseys is a one woman run business but I often collaborate with other business owners and creatives. I had a fantastic UCSD Student intern in 2019 who helped me take Roseys from version 1.0 to 2.0 and I helped her start her own marketing business and networking community that she now works at full time. There is always so much we can learn from each other! Email resumes and interest to bethanyrose@roseys.love and include the following: S hare some of your relevant experience/interests/coursework/aspirations Y our availability for this position? ( number of hours per week and start/end dates) W ill you be seeking college credit for this internship? Questions? Feel free to reach out anytime at bethanyrose@roseys.love

I feel so grateful for everyone who has believed in me and supported my idea.

It feels like I‚Äôm an ant trying to carve a human sized sand castle, shaping it grain by grain by grain. Rather than diving deep into the branding, product development and high quality content development for a full collection was slow and tough but critical for me Launching a small scale minimum viable product with one model as fast as possible. I didn‚Äôt know fashion or business and at the time I was just starting to find a community and only getting a grasp on what shifting my perspective actually meant for me, I‚Äôve learned so much about all of the above and it‚Äôs shaped the brand into what it has become.

head first was worth it because most of the time I felt like I was showing off a heap from a dumped over bucket me IT LOOKS AWESOME and this is the moment when the pile of sand finally starts to resemble a proud little castle.

I sold 6 pairs in 2 days
3 per day for 365 = 164,250
solid goal.

Want a chance to have your work featured in a local film festival? Roseys Eyewear is a local rose-colored sunglasses startup created to remind us how it's always just a matter of perspective. Our signature sunset blossoming red lenses spark that moment of wonder that makes all San Diegan‚Äôs pause to look with love out on the horizon. Roseys is dedicated to discovering how to tune in to that sunset state of mind even when the rose-colored glasses come off by exploring the nature of consciousness and compassion with our community. This year, Roseys is working with a team of highly experienced mentors from the local fashion industry to grow into a mindful lifestyle brand, expanding into a collection of mindfully made rosey reminders for conscious closets and homes. This summer, Roseys‚Äô founder is looking to collaborate with local film makers and video editors to assist with the development of a documentary to showcase the brand's "See the World Bloom" philosophy while celebrating San Diego's epic natural beauty, making the case for creating a local fashion brand that protects our land and sea as much as we enjoy it. The film will be submitted to the first annual San Diego Environmental Film Festival this October (along with others) and used for a crowdfunding campaign to fund the next generation of Roseys' products to be radically good for the people and the planet. Collaborating on this project will allow you to build a portfolio working with a grassroots startup and receive professional development mentoring from the company's founder. Responsibilities: Roseys‚Äô internship program is structured to provide hands-on experience and one-on-one mentoring related to your major course of study that you are unable to find on campus. Each internship position is tailored to the academic areas of focus and professional aspirations of the students working with us. While some aspects of the project will have pre-defined guidance and workflows, others will be up to your own creativity - your input and new ideas are always welcome :) This is a great creative opportunity to hone your skills while growing your local network and hopefully having your work featured in a local film festival (or more!). The available roles may assist with any of the following: - Development and pre-production planning - Production - filming and sourcing media of: active San Diego lifestyle (surfing, skateboarding, hiking, dancing, yoga, fire spinning, aerial, etc ) news and interviews with thought leaders in fashion, sustainability/ethics, and mindfulness/ meditation/ psychology San Diego‚Äôs epic natural beauty - Post-production editing in Adobe CC - Music licensing research - Film festival research Experience: Functional understanding of filmmaking with Adobe Creative Cloud (including Premiere Pro, Audition, Illustrator, Photoshop, Lightroom). Filming is not a required role for this position. Editors and other areas of interest welcome. If you already have video work you think would fit the media we're planning to source, we'd love to hear from you! Please share any existing video projects or related work in your application. Equipment: Computer with internet and Adobe CC. Filming can use in-house cameras and drones but please share details in your application if you have your own equipment along with your experience using it. Term: full-time, part-time, or project based. Compensation: This position is unpaid, applicants seeking college credits, references, and hands on experiences welcome! Remote/In-person: This internship is primarily remote but in person availability and transportation in Pacific Beach/San Diego city is preferred for ease of creative collaboration and assistance on the pieces we haven‚Äôt filmed yet. We will have virtual meetings and communication via phone, text, email, video conferencing as needed. Professional mentoring: I love supporting aspiring business owners and creatives and am always happy to help advise and brainstorm on your own pursuits. Roseys is a one woman run business, but I often collaborate with other business owners and creatives.

When I had the idea to create Roseys, it was my dream to make a product with a positive social and environmental impact, but the cost s were far beyond my reach and I felt I needed to validate the idea to myself before committing to the project to raise funding or bring on partners . I was new to San Diego and barely knew anyone in the county, let alone the industry. So, as a bootstrapping solo entrepreneur , I set out to create a minimum viable product to test the idea within my own means. Through two iterations of prototyping , research and development, and market testing small batch collections , I saw there was really something to this rose colored experience that captivated a much wider demographic than I expected . Through the pandemic the need for the deeper message has become even more relevant. I supported myself through buying a home where I could host two Airbnb suites on the first floor and became a freelance design er and digital operations manage r for my favorite local s ustainable fashion startup, Luna Wild Collection.

Business Plan Template for a Startup Business A startup business plan serves several purposes. It can help convince investors or lenders to finance your business. It can persuade partners or key employees to join your company . Most important ly , it serves as a roadmap guiding the launch and growth of your new business. Writing a business plan is an opportunity to carefully think through every step of starting your company so you can prepare for success. This is your chance to discover any weaknesses in your business idea, identify opportunities you may not have considered, and plan how you will deal with challenges that are likely to arise. Be honest with yourself as you work through your business plan. Don‚Äôt gloss over potential problems; instead, figure out solutions. A good business plan is clear and concise. A person outside of your industry should be able to understand it. Avoid overusing industry jargon or terminology. Most of the time involved in writing your plan should be spent researching and thinking. Make sure to document your research, including the sources of any information you include. Avoid making unsubstantiated claims or sweeping statements. Investors, lenders and others reading your plan will want to see realistic projections and expect your assumptions to be supported with facts. This template includes instructions for each section of the business plan, followed by corresponding fillable worksheet/s. The last section in the instructions, ‚ÄúRefining Your Plan,‚Äù explains ways you may need to modify your plan for specific purposes, such as getting a bank loan, or for specific industries, such as retail . Proofread your completed plan (or have someone proofread it for you) to make sure it‚Äôs free of spelling and grammatical errors and that all figures are accurate.

It should convey your enthusiasm for your business idea and get readers excited about it, too. Write your Executive Summary LAST , after you have completed the rest of the business plan.

Identify your target customer groups , and create a demographic profile for each group that includes: For consumers: Age Gender Location Income Occupation Education level For businesses: Industry Location Size Stage in business (startup, growing, mature) Annual sales Key competitors One of the biggest mistakes you can make in a business plan is to claim you have ‚Äúno competition.‚Äù Every business has competitors.

https://mmtcp.soundstrue.com/apply/ https://mmtcp.soundstrue.com/#a_aid=5dcd8762906ed&a_bid=aaed7515 Sitting - Prior to my recent retreat, my sitting practice was usually about 10-30 mins daily meditation (typically in the late morning ) either a guided meditation or some combination of my own insight and serenity practices, typically metta, breath/body awareness, open awareness, RAIN. This used to be almost always sitting meditation until I learned more about walking meditation in POA. Since recently completing the retreat on the ƒÄnƒÅpƒÅnasati Sutta I have been more inclined to follow its practice. I realized the deep concentration that can unfold from 60 min+ sitting/walking which profoundly deepened my insight practices. With this newfound appreciation and cohesive skill set from both POA and the retreat, I have begun to incorporate longer sits as my time allows. Mindful movement - yoga, biking, walking, running, surfing. Making an intentional practice of maintaining continuity of awareness of the body/sensations/experience and coming back to it over and over throughout the activity. I usually do basic yoga to get comfortable before /after sitting. Mindful moments - of serenity and insight practices throughout the day such as pausing, micro-meditations, noting, RAIN/metta for difficult emotions, calming myself and asking, what is true in this moment? where can I feel this? what does this need? Journaling - As needed or as guided by any programs I‚Äôm attending. For my personal practice this usually means noting observations while sitting including top thoughts/experiences or some profound insight into the way I‚Äôm practicing or some shift in perspective. When working with something difficult I will free write to hear out my inner narratives to try to understand them more deeply. Dhamma study ‚Äì T hroughout the week I typically listen to some dharma talks or meditation related podcasts. I am always reading a book or two based on vipassana or an affiliated psychologist. Mindfulness by Joseph Goldstien has been a book I always revisit as a reference to my practice. I just finished reading Mindsight by Daniel J Spiegel , I have been listening to Fierce Compassion by Kristen Neff (at the recommendation of my mentor) and just started reading Mindfulness of Breathing by Bhikkhu AnƒÅlayo (at the recommendation of my retreat teacher). While I have an established practice of daily meditation activities, I‚Äôve noticed that over the years my practice and the Eightfold Path influences , informs , and punctuates more and more of my daily life the more I sit, study , and participate in Sanghas . Sangha ‚Äì I have participated in sitting groups hosted by Insight Meditation Society San Diego which was much more frequent earlier in the establishment of my practice but the demographic was significantly older, the travel was difficult for me due to the location, and it was held on Saturday mornings which was tough on my schedule . It has been a few years since I‚Äôve sat with them but I‚Äôve participated in several local mediation groups from various organizations since then , mostly online or through yoga communities . Through the pandemic I found sangha in the POA community. Now as I‚Äôm getting back to social life with a much deeper dedication and commitment to my practice, I ‚Äôm excited to say I have started to gather interest from those in my local community who frequently ask me questions about meditation to start a sitting group more central to where I‚Äôm located with people closer to my demographic so we can study and practice together. I will be organizing this with the guidance of my mentor to ensure I facilitate a group in a safe way that allows for healthy exploration with resources for support. If applicable, please list any teaching experience you have in meditation in the past three years. Please include what style or tradition in which the meditation is taught, and what organization or retreat center you are affiliated with. Please note, previous teaching experience is not a requirement for acceptance. While I am not a teacher by any means I thought this would be an appropriate place to share how I connect my friends, family and community to the meditation teachers and philosophies I follow. I created a rose-colored sunglasses company called Roseys Eyewear as a way to share the loving awareness I was discovering through vipassana. Their sunset blossoming effect really captivates people and is a wordless reminder that peace and beauty are always just a matter of perspective. Every pair comes with a little poem that reflects my practice . Roseys are a catalyst and platform to start conversations around mindfulness and compassion , share my experience from a student‚Äôs perspective, and connect my community to the history, research, and publications that have helped me understand the mindfulness movement and remember how to look with love. Since starting Roseys , I‚Äôve gotten a lot of growing interest to share my practice with my friends and community, and while I feel having conversations and sharing my journey as a student is important to inspire others since that is how I was inspired , I have become a directory rather than a teacher . I don‚Äôt feel at liberty to teach meditation and I don‚Äôt think I will until I have much more in-depth experience and understanding on guiding people through such a personal and vulnerable practice . I‚Äôm very much looking forward to learning how best to share these practices through MMTCP if I am accepted. Do you have any history of psychological difficulties? Mild ADHD that has been greatly supported by my practice. If yes, please describe the challenges and circumstances: Have you experienced any significant trauma or emotional, psychological, or spiritual difficulties in your life that affected your ability to function? Are there any other details about your current life situation that would be helpful for us to know? I am self employed so my schedule is flexible and I will be ready to adapt to allow for plenty of time for MMTCP should I be accepted. Orientation Thanks for the other option! I don‚Äôt quite identify with any of the above as I feel odd labeling my sexualit y . I‚Äôm not very immersed in these cultures so I don‚Äôt quite know what they all mean to the people who use them/hear them . I‚Äôm more than happy to be labeled as LGBTQ+ or queer for the purposes of diversity and inclusion , to help others feel welcome and not alone üòä Please briefly describe what draws you to participate in The Mindfulness Meditation Teacher Certification Program. I want to deepen my own practice and learn how best to share it with others. My goal is to make mindfulness, compassion, and mindful community more accessible and interesting to the world through interactive experiences, music, art, and technology. ------------- I believe the root of the world‚Äôs troubles begins within our own minds, the Buddha‚Äôs three poisons, greed, hatred, and delusion. I want to help the world wake up to this reality and its wisdom. Early in my discovery of vipassana I created a company called Roseys Eyewear, a rose-colored sunglasses company dedicated to ‚Äúseeing the world bloom‚Äù with understanding, compassion, and generosity. I share the rose-colored experience because it captivates people with a similar attentive loving awareness that I‚Äôve found through my mediation practice. It‚Äôs a reflection of the inner blossoming that can happen within when we learn to understand ourselves and cultivate a wholesome heart. I ‚Äôve use d it as a way of start ing a dialog around mindfulness and connect ing others with the teachers and practices that have helped me to ‚Äúsee the world bloom‚Äù. My goal is to make mindfulness, compassion, and sangha more accessible and interesting to the world, no matter who is listening, through interactive experiences, visual art and technology. My journey to find vipassana and establish a meditation practice was convoluted. as a reflection of the inner blossoming that can happen within when we learn to understand ourselves and cultivate a wholesome heart. Their sunset perspective -- With an education in Environmental Conservation and International Affairs , a previous professional background as an Environmental Scientist, and years of dedication to my vipassana practice, I have become more and more aware of the causes of the suffering of the Earth and it‚Äôs beings . I believe the root of the world‚Äôs troubles begins within our own minds , the Buddha‚Äôs three poisons, greed, hatred, and delusion. I want to help the world wake up to this reality and its wisdom . Early in my discovery of vipassana I created a company called Roseys Eyewear, a rose-colored sunglasses company dedicated to ‚Äú seeing the world bloom ‚Äù with understanding, compassion, and generosity . I share the rose-colored experience as a reflection of the inner blossoming that can happen within when we learn to understand ourselves and cultivat e a wholesome heart. Their sunset perspective captivates people with awe, the same present and attentive loving awareness I‚Äôve found through my practice. I use it as a reminder that while we can‚Äôt change what we see, we can change the lenses we look through. My journey to find vipassana was convoluted. My goal is to make mindfulness , compassion , and sangha more accessible and interesting to the world , no matter who is listening , through interactive experiences, visual art and technology. --- Early on in my vipassana practice, I felt a huge shift in the way I saw the world and myself. I had searched for years for ways to understand my unhappiness without every really getting to the point. When I finally learned to ‚Äúzoom out‚Äù , as I had called it, it was as if this new perspective was always there on the surface to be discovered . I was the youngest Project Manager at my company and the first to ever work fully remote, but the pressure and disconnection were getting to me. Through my new practice, I found I could tune in to an open and spacious loving awareness and just ‚Äúbe‚Äù in the very moment , beyond the grasp of my self-imposed self-concepts . On several occasions , I felt my heart open with such boundless compassion and acceptance for myself and others and life that all the expectations I was holding onto so tightly seemed to just fall away on their own . The more I learned and practiced, l ittle by little , moment by moment, I felt a little more at ease in a way I never had before. I felt I could intentionally cultivate this sense of compassion in myself, relax, step outside of my assumptions and reactions and look at the state of my mind, or the world, or a situation with love. For Christmas that year I asked for a mediation cushion, a notebook, and Mindfulness in Plain English which taught me the nuances of sitting and practicing. I immersed myself in audiodharma.org, a series on the Eightfold Path by Gil Fronsdale , and talks from Jack, Tara, Joseph, Sharon . I started seeing them gain a lot of positive traction on popular podcasts like Tim Ferris ‚Äô and Sam Harris‚Äô and I read 10% Happier which solidified my confidence in the power of the practice. I joined a sangha at IMS San Diego and really started to learn the foundations of the Buddha‚Äôs teachings which spoke so directly to my inner struggles and kept me dedicated to learning. Through my practice I was starting to notice how the waves of life‚Äôs ups and downs could take me over for the worse and learning a different way to relate to them, with awareness and compassion. I was seeing those waves take over all the people in my life and I wanted to help them wake up . To me , this realization seemed so simple , tangible , and on the surface that anyone could learn to glimpse it but it had such transience and complex depth and involved so much vulnerability that it kept me from trying to teach anyone myself, but I felt so motivated to connect anyone who was interested with the teachers and practices I was learning . I would share them whenever the opportunity would arise. Despite the profound insights that could be found, I noticed that not many people really ha ve the time or energy to expose themselves to enough of it (the talks, the books, the interviews , the guided meditations ) to hit something that really resonates and draws them in to learn for themselves. On top of that, I saw my own journey in my exposure to meditation and mindfulness be so diluted and woo-woo-washed that my trust in it was tenuis for many years before I even started to try to sit and meditate. It was a long journey to come to vipassana and understand its place in the greater cultural movement to wake up from our thoughts What are the personal strengths that you sense will enable you to teach meditation well to others? Open compassionate heart. Confident yet humble attitude. Honors history and scientific method. Respects established teachers/therapists. Background in science, int‚Äôl affairs, conservation. Sees challenges as creative opportunities. Motivation to grow What are the areas of your inner life and behavior that you sense need attention and development in order for you to serve well as a teacher? I would like to deepen my ability to see from and be sensitive to other's perspectives, to better understand how they might perceive me, my words and my actions and to know more deeply how my personal conditioning can influence and delude this effort This training program is delivered through an online learning platform with live and pre-recorded video teachings, reading assignments, and monthly Mentor & Peer Groups meeting through the Zoom video conferencing platform. Do you anticipate any challenges in learning in this format? What are your concerns, if any? No. I have discussed at length with my personal mentor (a mentor in MMTCP) and was gathered with several participants in a session during my retreat to hear about their experience. I'm excited and confident! The program is innovative in the ways it will help you to build awareness of how mindfulness and compassion can support diversity, equity, and inclusion, particularly around race. What draws you to this learning? What are your concerns, if any? This is a huge part of what draws me to participate in MMTCP. I am very interested in understanding exactly this for my own personal development, my businesses, my community, my public participation, and my future of sharing the dhamma. Once you graduate and become certified to teach mindfulness meditation, how do you see yourself using this certification? Are there specific applications of mindfulness you are interested in teaching and/or are there specific communities you‚Äôre interested in working with? I see myself collaborating with more established teachers/therapists to develop creative ways through art, music and technology to share the practice and solve challenges that hinder people around the world from benefitting from it. Is there anything else you would like us to know? I founded Rose

DOCS I loved this exercise wow! I learned so much haha brand values wonder, perspective, love Brand philosophy mindfulness, compassion, wisdom Key qualities Want to watch over and over again Pleasant and fun on the eyes/ears Educational and info rich feeding a void of deep curiosity and answering my questions along the way Fact based and legitimate Natural conversations Clean graphics seem trustworthy Instantly want to share it with everyone I know or turn on it there‚Äôs people around who want something to watch and can half listen but still follow along About deeply passionate people exploring their passions Mystery and adventure Tops - watched the last two multiple times, will watch most unknown more for sure Most unknown The interwoven story, the mystery of what they‚Äôre going to discover and talk about, the naturalness of the conversations because it‚Äôs scientists talking to each other in a genuine convo rather than an invisible interviewer. Thr intrigue over the connections between the different scientists. The science. The clean/ dark/ minimalist animation style when they‚Äôre mapping it out. The fact that in the beginning you know where the journey starts and is is going to end but you don‚Äôt know why. The fact that it was premised as an ‚Äúexperiment‚Äù. I‚Äôm all about mysteries and adventures and figuring things out and mapping them out and getting a the pieces and perspectives (in life and docs). You trust the scientists are genuine people having genuine conversations about actual scientific research and truthful about what their fields do not know. View from a blue moon The sound track The long surf scenes to songs The cuteness of the editing like when Kelly slater pops his head over the fence Easy on the eyes Want to just turn on when people are over without needing to pay attention to it Hamiltons pharmacopeia follow the creator outside of the documentary and know about everything they‚Äôre involved in / listen to all interviews The mysterious and curious intro monologue (Hamilton is the best) Season 3 e 1 intro as he talks about his guilt for all the mistakes he made in the previous films and his impact on the preservation of the Sonoran dessert toad‚Ä¶ I super relate to this anxiety and am terrified to do this in some way with anything I do ü§Ø Def should bring awareness and interview someone about mental health and how it‚Äôs important to have a therapist to work through these things because i experienced myself what not having one is like when it gets too low to handle and don‚Äôt want that to happen to anyone - everyone should have someone they can go to in an emergency mental health situation / have disclaimers about not providing medical advice / dangers of meditation / share mental health awareness and support links Other tops‚Ä¶ How to Change You Mind The Vow Andy Warhol diaries Art of flight Chefs table Cosmos DONT LIKE goop - It comes off as peddling woo woo and it had such a chance to be good with paltrows platform. Too weird pop health and not scientific. I‚Äôve thought how I want to make my own version about the REAL science of wellbeing and holistic health and being honest about what‚Äôs not validated with real data and offering different perspectives from legitimate scientists. And also not build an empire off of bs trash and nonsense‚Ä¶ I could go on. Probably the best example of what I don‚Äôt want but in kind of the same genre. Fantastic fungi - I heard so much about it from Everyone but it was just not memorable for me. I didn‚Äôt even feel the desire to watch it again or recommend it. Maybe because I learned about mushrooms in school so nothing was new to me, you‚Äôd think it would have a hook for mushroom enthusiasts but it didn‚Äôt for me‚Ä¶ maybe I should watch it again to see what if I was missing something‚Ä¶ maybe I fell asleep or was tired but I watched most unknown exhausted and woke up because it was so interesting.

----- Since the inception of the idea for Roseys Eyewear , the founder has been focused on researching and developing the brand concept, analyzing product market fit, and exploring her understanding of her rose-colored philosophy while learning about business and design on the fly. As the founder searched for the perfect rose-colored len s she learned that the ‚Äúradically good‚Äù product she dreamed of was near impossible , especially without significant funding and industry connections . With uncertainty over how the rose-colored concept would be received , no prior experience in business or design, such a personal connection to the brand, and determination to never put profit over purpose ; the founder decided to self-fund a small minimum viable product collection of gold circle frames with red lenses she named after one of the first awe-struck descriptions she heard from someone ‚Äúseeing the world bloom‚Äù ‚Äì Major Sunsets. With little to invest, the goal was to analyze product market fit and test the founder‚Äôs hypothesis if the captivating experience of the product could sell itself . S ince the concept for Roseys was founded on sharing the ir captivating effect , rather than investing into digital marketing, the founder focused on analyzing the in-person customer experience by selling them at key events for her target audience. At music festivals, pool parties, and Roseys‚Äô home at Mustache Bash, the founder watched the rose-color experience perpetuate sales without effort . A friend would share them with a stranger who would buy a pair, the n the experience would be passed along from one blossom to the next as new people tapped on the founder‚Äôs shoulder to bloom. While only 10-15 pairs sold over 4-5 hours at these types of events , the effortlessness to sell and wonder in each new blossom ‚Äô s face reaffirmed there was something special to this rose-colored experience. While test the company‚Äôs hypothesis if the captivating experience of the product could sell itself. The founder launched a website and a few amateur Instagram campaigns featuring posts with quotes from favorite meditation teachers and rose-colored stock imagery of San Diego , building a local following. Digital sales were challenging with no marketing budget or experience in social media or web design, but the initial launch ‚Äôs highly amateur Instagram campaign and bare bones website sold 20 pairs starting from zero following and with minimal effort over 9 weeks, averaging 1 pair per post and a 5% conversion rate. A single 20$ ad test returned $ 105 in revenue. Still, rather than attempting to scale digitally, the founder opted to focus her time on the project in personal interactions to understand the customer s and the products value to them.

Not long after the idea for Roseys began to grow, the founder left her corporate consulting job. After a rollercoaster of product development and initial testing , the founder put her newfound entrepreneurship to work and bought her dream hom e in Pacific Beach by making a business plan to host two private Airbnb guest suites on the first floor . Hosting allowed the founder to continue to develop her rose-colored vision . starting up the property and continue chase her rose-colored dream. In between other business pursuits, the founder‚Äôs work on the business has involved several small-scale initiatives . Digital marketing several local events retail, the company has identified its true customer advocates and product market fit. The company has sold over rose colored earning over $15,000 in revenue to date and becoming a locally recognized symbol of love in local yoga and music communities. Since the inception of the idea, the founder developed and self-funded two small minimal viable product collections of rose-colored sunglasses to analyze and validate the market while learning on the go how to build and run a fashion brand.¬† In the first year of business, the company observed a positive market response to small scale Facebook ads, self-run Instagram growth trials, and got a wholesale order from the first retail store they approached. The founder sold Roseys from her backpack at music festivals and yoga events throughout Southern California by watching the contagious captivation of her product sell itself through word of mouth in real time.

MISSION Roseys Eyewear is a San Diego startup reminding the world how wonder and love are always just a matter of perspective through rose-red sunset blossoming sunglasses. The company reflects the founder's own journey to find and share sustained peace and sustainable fashion, sparked by a realization that her rose-colored glasses could captivate wearers with the beauty of the present moment. PHILOSOPHY It is easy to watch the world wither through fear‚Äôs lenses of anxiety, depression, and ignorance; but we can choose to look with love‚Äôs lenses of awareness, grace, and wisdom. Roseys‚Äô rose-red lenses sprout the same experience that makes everyone pause at sunset as they see the world bloom and feel their love blossom. We believe that cultivating the grounds of mindfulness and compassion through meditation is what lets our innate ‚Äúsunset state of mind‚Äù to flourish naturally. It is those glimpses when the sun goes down that prove it is as simple as putting on a pair of rose-colored glasses. Roseys Eyewear is a for-profit company, but its mission is much more than just making money. The company strives to make mindful living and mindful consumerism more accessible to everyone. VISION The company was planted in San Diego to seed a revolution of loving awareness in human consciousness and radical goodness in the coastal lifestyle retail industry. Roseys Eyewear shares mindfully made rosy reminders of life‚Äôs beauty while growing a global community to support each other in seeing the world bloom through meditation. Through its products, community, and advocacy, Roseys Eyewear is propagating a global shift from greed to generosity, hatred to empathy, delusion to understanding, and from fear to love. With such a mindful mission, Roseys are created in small batches to reduce waste and innovate as we work towards our goal of becoming a radically good company that pioneers corporate sustainability, ethics, and transparency. PRODUCT Roseys Eyewear offers unique sunglasses that not only stand out in the industry with their signature rose-red lenses, but with their sharable sunset blossoming experience and deeply rooted positive message. Each collection is designed with a meditative unboxing experience to inspire wearers to look with love and create a dialog around mindfulness and compassion in the founder‚Äôs community. Over the next year, the company is planning to expand into a lifestyle brand of mindfully made rosey reminders for the conscious closet and home. INDUSTRY We believe that our company will be a disruptor that fills a need in the coastal lifestyle industry for purpose-driven standout eyewear and fashion products that take radical responsibility for the impacts on the environment they celebrate and the people who create them. The company will also fill a need in the mental health industry for empowering advocacy and community that solves the challenges of committed mindfulness practice through science-backed philosophies that point to the simplicity and positive impacts of meditation along with a digital collective that allows meditators to connect and grow together. TARGET MARKET As the founder researched and developed the concept over the years, the company has established a growing local and social media presence and a passionate following among fashion-savvy, positive-minded young people who value conscious consumerism. The company targets 20 to 30-something, light-seeking, dancefloor-hopping adventurers, who strive to look upon every moment as they would a blossoming flower. The company‚Äôs true advocates are those who value unique, mindfully made fashion, have a deep desire to maintain a rosy perspective between the glimpses in their adventures, and endeavor to live a balanced life. In recent retail feedback, the company has observed a widening age demographic and a near even distribution of customer gender but skews towards young women. GOALS The company is seeking to refine its business plan to scale its digital funnel and formalize its meditation community in the near term and scale as a mindfully made coastal lifestyle brand through 2023. In the near term, the company is planning to launch a digital campaign to sell remaining inventory and new collaborative products to grow its digital presence. The campaign will also formalize and grow its mindful community by forming a digital collective to support regular meditation practice and raising awareness about mental health. By the end of 2022, the company is planning to launch a crowdfunding campaign to raise funding to research and develop its next collection of rose-colored eyewear with radical awareness and responsibility for its impacts on the people and the planet. While the company is seeking mentorship to form a strategy and determine costs and sales forecasts, it projects it will set a goal to raise up to $75,000 with an estimated revenue of $300,000 for its next eyewear collection. Through 2023, the company also plans to formally research the therapeutic benefits of both red lenses and meditation with local universities. HISTORY The idea for Roseys Eyewear was founded in 2017 by Bethany Rose Cannon, an optimistic environmental scientist and experienced meditator with an obsession over captivating people with her red sunglasses. Over the years, the founder has focused on strategic sales and marketing initiatives to test and analyze product market fit and observe how the product can sell itself through the rose-colored experience‚Äôs wordless word of mouth marketing. Through two small self-funded collections of minimum viable products, the company has earned over $15,000 to date with consistent linear growth and a positive market response both online and in retail. The company has sold over 500 pairs of Roseys, starting out through the founder‚Äôs backpack and growing through Instagram, Amazon, local retail, and event pop-ups. The founder‚Äôs additional entrepreneurial pursuits as an Airbnb Superhost and digital operations lead of Luna Wild Collection, a local rapidly growing sustainable fashion startup and top Roseys retailer, have allowed her to become self-employed and earn passive income while building a virtual team and gaining business experience to support the growth of Roseys Eyewear. A future partnership with Bad Madge & Co., a South Park vintage shop and top Roseys retailer, will support the founder in rebranding her Airbnbs into immersive shoppable accommodations that showcase local mindful products and serve as a launching pad for new Roseys‚Äô lifestyle products. Since its founding, the company has built a strong brand identity as a locally recognizable symbol of love in yoga and music communities and strategic partnerships with successful retailers with the same target market in new verticals. TEAM Roseys Eyewear is a single-member Limited Liability Company founded and operated by Bethany Rose Cannon. The company is a namesake of her family‚Äôs symbol of love, Nana Rose, and her Albanian-rooted family color, rose-red. A creative self-made entrepreneur with a passion for living a mindful adventurous lifestyle and a background in environmental conservation, Bethany brings to the company a wide range of skills in business, retail, e-commerce, design, environmental impact mitigation, scientific research and analysis; as well as formal vipassana meditation practice, mentorship, and soon-to-be teacher training. As she developed and validated the concept for Roseys Eyewear, her other business endeavors have provided her with independence, experience, and resources to grow the company. The founder has grown a team of experienced industry experts, professionals, and strategic partners who are passionate about supporting Roseys Eyewear in its mission to become a global force for good. The founder has secured seasoned mentors and sourcing partners with passions for purpose-driven brands and backgrounds at local staples including Nixon, Raen, Spy, and Stance. The founder regularly consults with and is supported by Powerfuel Damas, a local marketing agency and international women's entrepreneur community, co-founded by the company‚Äôs 2019 UCSD marketing student intern. The founder has grown her network in corporate responsibility to plan the company‚Äôs ‚ÄúRoadmap to Radical Goodness‚Äù including ongoing partnerships with the Ocean Optimism Movement, an conservation success advocacy non-profit; Hey Social Good, a local social impact analytics firm; Snaplinc Consulting, a sustainability and ethics consulting firm; and a UCSD environmental policy student. The founder is collaborating with a local filmmaker to produce a short film to be submitted this October to the first annual San Diego Environmental Film Festival (co-founded by Hey Social Good‚Äôs founder) and other similar festivals to support its crowdfunding campaign and inspire corporate responsibility through optimism. The founder has also formed partnerships with local artists, retail curators, apparel production houses, seamstresses, and content creators to support the company‚Äôs future expansion from eyewear into a mindfully made coastal lifestyle brand. Since 2020, the founder has been mentored by an experienced meditation teacher and psychologist to deepen her practice. In 2023, the founder will join UC Berkeley's Mindfulness Meditation Teacher Certification Program, to learn from her two favorite world renown teachers and personal mentor how to best share mindfulness and compassion with the world. After almost five years of testing the concept for Roseys Eyewear and establishing a network of experienced industry experts, the founder is poised to achieve the company‚Äôs goals to scale in 2023. WHY DO YOU WANT TO JOIN? As Roseys Eyewear has taken root over the years, such a community and team has grown around it to support its true vision and I believe joining SDSI‚Äôs accelerator program will help ensure I have the best plan to turn it into a reality. After a mentor-referred conversation with Charlie Ninegar, he recommended I apply to the program. In the twenty minutes we spoke, I heard feedback and insight that I know can only be understood from over a decade of working in the industry. I know SDSI will be a priceless experience to learn from industry experts, like Charlie, the best way to approach my business goals while gaining critical feedback and input. It is opportune timing , because this application window has coincided with several partnerships, opportunities, and new information that have all led me to put the first draft of my new business plan on paper . I hope to refine this plan through SDSI. As I have tested my business concept at a small scale, having no formal education in business , design, or marketing has been immensely rewarding but just as challenging. I have realized as a solo entrepreneur that time is scarce, but collaboration can create exponential impacts. My goal with SDSI is to learn how to be strategic, informed, and effective to best orchestrate and prioritize all the company‚Äôs opportunities and visions. While it would be easier to scale Roseys Eyewear using industry standard supply chains and practices, I left my career as an environmental scientist not to sell sunglasses, but to make a positive impact on the world. In my professional background and education in e nvironmental c onservation and i nternational a ffairs, I saw that positive global change can happen when grassroots innovators step up to challenge the status quo with an unbiased understanding for all the stakeholders involved.¬†I have learned from my mentors that it can be difficult to retrofit established business models and manufacturers to meet the growing demand and heightening standards for sustainability and ethics. I hope to use this opportunity to challenge myself and my team of SDSI mentors to implement radically responsible business practices from the start. I hope to be guided as I collaborate with experts to evaluate social and environmental impacts of my next eyewear collection and innovate around the challenges the industry faces in taking responsibility for them. The expertise required for such an endeavor pose a substantial upfront cost which I hope to learn how to successfully fund through crowdfunding or other avenues . I have several opportunities to grow with my existing inventory and collaborate with local partners on new products that I hope to strategically plan through SDSI‚Äôs program. I also hope to learn how to make mindfulness and compassion more accessible through my brand , grow a community around it, and empower advocates of my mission. I believe SDSI will be an integral support system to establish Roseys Eyewear in a way that will consistently perpetuate its growth and influence goodness in the industry and the world.

Startup Business Plan Template The term ‚Äústartup‚Äù has become a familiar part of the business lexicon and is often used to describe fast-growing, entrepr eneur-led companies in the technology sector. Actually , a startup is any business enterprise that has recently been established. If you are in the early stages of starting a business, one of the first steps you will need to take is to create a business plan. This s imple template was designed to help someone new to the business world to easily put together a professional plan describing a new venture. Keep your startup plan short. As your business matures, you can adapt the pl an to include additional detail. You can create different iterations of it for different audiences. The bank will want more financial information, but a new employee might be more interested in your company‚Äôs mission statement and your plan for selling the product or service. Executive Summary An executive summary is a crucial part of any business plan. It should come first in your document. The executive summary gives the reader, who may be a very busy bank executive, a chance to understand your business in a quick, one-page read. In no more than a short paragraph for each point , summarize the sections of your business plan: Give your elevator pitch and briefly describe your company Summarize the market research you have done Present the problem you are aiming to solve Describe how your product or service solves the problem Introduce key management Provide a synopsis of your sales and marketing plan Explain your financial plan Close your executive summary with a clear explanation of your project, why it is needed, and how it will benefit future customers and investors. HubSpot Tip: Write this section last, after you have written all of the other sections. It should summarize your entire business plan in about a page. About the Company Describe what makes your company different. This section should convince readers that your business idea is important and that the product or service that you will offer is needed. Present your company ‚Äôs name, location, type of business, ownership, and significant assets. Describe your company‚Äôs mission: What is your reason for existence? Describe the values on which you are founding the company. List the company‚Äôs goals and objectives and explain how you fit into the industry. HubSpot Tip: Keep this section brief . The remainder of the document allows space for you to go into more detail about your business. Market Analysis Before writing your business plan, you need to conduct research on the market and industry you are planning to enter. Based on that research, you should describe your industry, the opportunities it offers, and the growth it is experiencing. Describe the key environmental trends in your industry. What are the barriers to entry (e.g., high production or marketing costs, tariff barriers, regulatory challenges, extensive training)? How is the industry progressing? What is changing? You should also d efine your target customers. Who will buy your product or service? Who are your major competitors? Identify and describe them . Ide ntify what defines your product or service in the marketplace. What distinctive competencies or offerings do you provide that other companies do not? HubSpot Tip: Note the key factors for success in this industry, and focus on proving that your company has them . The Problem Describe the need in the market that your business idea will fill. How did this need arise and why has it not been filled yet? Explain how you identified the need and how your product or service will meet it. HubSpot Tip: Keep this section short, as the focus should be on your solution , which you will describe in the next part of the business plan . Our Solution Describe the product s or services your business will provide . I nclude your value proposition - describe how your service/product is attractive to customers. You should also include a description of the featur es and benefits of your product or service to your customer. Consider capturing this in a simple table like the one below. Product/Service Feature Benefit to the Customer HubSpot Tip: You can include photos or brochures of your products, but consider putting them in an appendix so that they do not interrupt the message in your narrative . Organizational Structure Since your company is just starting, it is likely that you do not have many people on your staff. Describe the key o perations and management roles in your company, and provide brief biographical sketches of your leadership. The aim is to show to readers that your team has the skills and qualifications to implement what you have outlined in the business plan. If you receive advice from a board of directors or any high-level external a dvisors, mention them in this section. HubSpot Tip: The b iographical sketch es should include the educational credentials, r elevant experience, and related accomplishments of your leaders . Consider personalizing your plan by including headshots of your staff. Sales and Marketing Strategy In this section, you should d escribe how yo u will promote your new product or service. Begin by identifying challenges with entering the market and explain how you will overcome them. You can use a table like the one below to outline the barriers and your solutions. Market Barrier/Challenge Our Solution Justify the following choices you have made: Location ‚Äì Does it bring cost savings? Is it close to your customer base? Pricing Strategy ‚Äì How will it entice customers to buy your products or services? How will it lead to profit s for you r business and investors? Promotion Plan - Will you use print, radio, television, or social media? Will you hire a marketing manager? Note the budget for your marketing strategy and tell the reader how you will obtain the funding for this important aspect of your business. If you plan to use consu ltants or an advertising agency, include these costs in your budget . HubSpot Tip: Consider including a few mockups of your company‚Äôs logos, branding, or marketing materials in an a ppendix . Financ ial P lan Describe the cost structure and financial aspects of the business. E xplain the kind and amount of investment that you need, what you will use the money for, and how you envision you r business becoming profitable. To g ive readers a peek into your company‚Äôs projected financial future , you should include as much of the following financial information as possible. Remember, your business plan is a livi ng document, so even if you do not have all of this information at the startup stage, you can add it as your business matures. Cash flow projection ‚Äì An estimate of how much money you expect to flow in and out of your business. Capitalization plan ‚Äì Lists the sources and uses of capital that your business plans to amass. Break-even analysis ‚Äì A determination of what you need to sell in order to cover the costs of doing business. Income statement ‚Äì Also known as a profit and loss statement (P&L), it shows the company‚Äôs revenues and expenses over a period of time. B alance sheet ‚Äì A s tatement of the assets, liabilities, and capital of a business at a point in time. Financial documentation is often long, so you should reference them here and include copies in an appendix. HubSpot Tip: Not everyone is an expert in finance, but it plays an important role in starting a business. Unless you have an accounting background, consider seek ing assistance on this section of your plan. Implementation Plan Tell the reader how you will implement your business plan. Consider including a timeline like the one below to illustrate the steps in the process to getting your business up and running . Customize it with your dates and the specific steps you will take . HubSpot Tip: S et reasonable deadlines that you are able to meet , but that show your initiative and eagerness to realize your new venture . Conclusion In a few sentences, summarize the main point that you would like the reader to understand about your business. This can vary based on the target audience. For example, if you are presenting your plan to a bank to ask for a loan, this section should focus on your financial viability and why the bank should choose to finance your business. Describe the next steps, and provide detailed contact information so that the reader can get in touch with you easily. HubSpot Tip: Your conclusion should incite the reader to act. Make it easy for them by including all of the information they need to move forward. Appendices Want to provide additional detail but need to avoid making your business plan too long? Y ou can insert documents in the Appendices and reference them in the text. In this way, you can provide more information without breaking up the flow of your business plan text. HubSpot Tip: Consider including examples of your marketing materials, a map of the business location, background research, images of your products, resumes of company leaders, or financial documents in the appendices of your business plan.

Estimated Time Commitments - Development Process - This will likely be the biggest tIme commitment with a potential for 1-2 hours a day¬† depending on the size of the line and how many styles are developed.¬† If the line is staying at 3 styles in 1 color each, that workload would be lower than a line of 10 styles in 4 colors each. Sample Production - Small time commitment, following up on open PO questions Sales/Planning/Forecasting - This is variable, depending on your needs.¬† I can build and manage forecast plans if desired Bulk Production Small time commitment managing PO status communication, keeping things on track.¬† Larger lines, with multiple factories would be a more involved process of course.

Competitive advantages Roseys Eyewear perceives an opportunity to acquire a significant amount of the sunglasses market share by creating purpose-driven eyewear and focusing on setting a new precedent for mindful business practices in Southern California‚Äôs coastal lifestyle retail industry. With guidance from the founder‚Äôs team of mentors, the company is seeking to be an industry disruptor by creating eyewear with uncompromised quality and unparalleled goodness. While the company hopes to influence the market to match its new standards for transparency, sustainability, and ethics; it will sustain its success by continuing to design timeless yet unique experiential styles, innovate to solve the challenges in the ever-disposable and ever-losable sunglasses industry, instill a deeply rooted community, identity, and purpose into the brand to create a personal connection and loyalty in its customers; and establish itself as a symbol of revolutionary loving awareness and thought leader in mindful living. We know it‚Äôs not that hard these days to sell a nice pair of sunglasses that are stylish and fit well, we are different for the following reasons: experiential sunglasses ‚Äì We make sunglasses that change the way you see the world, even when you take them off. Roseys Eyewear creates sunset blossoming lenses and mindful community to remind us how the wonder, perspective and love we feel when we gaze at the horizon at golden hour is always right between our ears. Wordless word of mouth ‚Äì Roseys spread wordlessly through their experience which often points wearers to that inner reminder of peace and beauty without saying a word. Revolution of loving awareness ‚Äì In an era of unprecedented anxiety, depression, and polarization and never enough time to learn how to cope; we‚Äôre bringing ease and accessibility to clinically proven and self-evident mindfulness and compassion practices that are as simple as putting on a pair of rose-colored glasses. Community ‚Äì Seeing ourselves and the world just as they are and cultivating a loving perspective towards them may be simple but it‚Äôs not easy and should not be done alone. The rose-colored experience plants seeds of curiosity and starts dialogs around mindfulness and compassion. Roseys Eyewear is building a mindful community to nurture it. mindfully made ‚Äì we‚Äôre responding to a lack of coastal lifestyle brands that meet the growing demand and the global need for eyewear and fashion that are truly sustainable, ethical, and transparent for the people and the planet. true - We have gathered substantial data on the growing preference for ethical fashion and the growing awareness of consumers to see through greenwashing. We want to prove that true corporate responsibility is possible and set a new precedent in the industry for true goodness. sowing positive impacts from our roots ‚Äì We are addressing a lag we see in coastal retail stores and big brands to heed to the global outcry to stop pollution and influence conscious consumerism. We have learned from our mentors that it is challenging to retrofit radical goodness onto established supply chains, products, and business models, so we are founding a collection that does it right from the start. Community over competition ‚Äì Our radical goodness will be a competitive advantage over the established coastal brands we love, but we won‚Äôt keep it a secret. We plan to share what we learn on along our journey to increase demand, accessibility, and community around corporate responsibility so more customers expect it and more business leaders are inspired to innovate to address it. Regulations are only matter of time - Countries around the world and some states in the U.S. are already taking a top-down approach to address the pollution, waste, and human rights violations in the fashion industry, it is only a matter of time before government constraints force brands to take responsibility, we want to prune the path of demand and possibility, so the industry does not wait. Unmatched quality and unparalleled goodness ‚Äì We have teamed up with mentors in eyewear, fashion, and social impact analysis to challenge the industry by making products that win over mainstream eyewear customers with uncompromising performance and turn them into advocates by proving that fashion can be ‚Äúas good as possible‚Äù rather than ‚Äúgood enough‚Äù. Buy it for life, not forever - Sunglasses get lost and broken, so we are innovating to push the limits of what is possible to make buy-it-for-life products that don‚Äôt last forever when they inevitably end up in the earth. Standout style ‚Äì On the ever-predictable retail shelves, Roseys‚Äô signature rose-red lenses will be the most eye-catching option on the market, turning timeless styles into experiential conversation pieces that symbolize a community, identity, and purpose to propagate goodness. So good its giftable ‚Äì We create products with such style, goodness, and personal connection that they make a meaningful gift. It starts in the mind ‚Äì Founded by an environmental scientist, we aim to become a culture and industry disruptor to influence radical personal and corporate responsibility by advocating for both individuals and business leaders to look inwards and out with love.

Market Research Needs: I'm looking to scope audience size, sales volume (if possible), sales revenue, and stores, in online/retail and high-end/affordable sunglasses/fashion by consumer pool, target audience, and core audience markets in Southern California, United States, and international regions. I'm also looking for any data you can provide on demographics, persona audience size, industry leaders, and competitive opportunities. Ideally this would cover both sunglasses and fashion markets but if you only have time for one, sunglasses is the priority. Attached is an example spreadsheet just to visualize the data I have in mind. This is the data I feel is necessary to support the first draft of my business plan to demonstrate my understanding of the market, my place in it, and the growth possible. I'm looking to quantify audiences and industry and their growth trajectories. This will ultimately quantify opportunity size and help determine goals for a 5-year growth plan I'm working on. I am new to most of this and preparing this to apply to an accelerator program to help scale my self-run business so I am open to any input or additional data you may have to help me make this case.

STORY Mission Rooted in a wish for every person to live a life well lived, Roseys Eyewear is a rose-colored sunglasses startup reminding the world how a sunset state of mind is always just a matter of perspective. Philosophy It‚Äôs easy to watch the world wither through fear‚Äôs anxiety, depression, and ignorance; but we can choose to look with love‚Äôs awareness, grace, and wisdom. Roseys‚Äô rose-red lenses sprout the same wonder that makes everyone pause at sunset as they see the world bloom and feel their love blossom. We believe that cultivating the grounds of mindfulness and compassion through meditation is what lets our innate rosy awareness flourish naturally. It‚Äôs those glimpses when the sun goes down that prove it‚Äôs as simple as putting on a pair of rose-colored glasses. Vision Roseys Eyewear was planted in San Diego to help seed a revolution of loving awareness in human consciousness and radical goodness in the fashion industry by sharing mindfully made rose-colored sunglasses and rosy reminders for the conscious closet and home while growing a global community of blossoms to support each other in seeing the world bloom. Goals Roseys Eyewear creates small batch rose-colored sunglasses and made-to-order eco-friendly apparel to reduce waste and innovate with every collection as we work towards our goal of becoming a climate positive company with products that are radically good for the people and the planet. The company will be seeking to refine the scope and strategies of its business plan to sow radical sustainability, ethics, and transparency into its next generation of rosy reminders; and expand beyond eyewear into a mindful lifestyle collection in retail and e-commerce by the end of 2023. The company will also be seeking to refine its business plan to grow its digital funnel and community of blossoms to increase brand awareness, raise funding, and gather data and feedback throughout the development of the 2023 collection. Through the end of 2022, the company will work with existing mentors and consultants to finalize its ‚ÄúRoadmap to Ultimate Goodness‚Äù; evaluate sustainable and ethical manufacturing options and business practices; and refine and forecast marketing, sales, and financial strategies and goals. This year, the company is planning to launch a digital mediation collective and campaign to support its existing community in its quest to maintain a rosy perspective and offer solutions to the challenges of establishing a regular mediation practice. Throughout the development of the 2023 collection, the company is planning to launch a new website, crowdfunding campaign, and short film to be submitted the first annual San Diego Environmental Film Festival and others to debut its story, philosophy, and journey to create radically good products. The company is also planning to launch The Rosey Place ‚Äì two mindfully curated shoppable Airbnb guest suites in Pacific Beach hosted by Roseys‚Äô founder and made shoppable through a website and social media. The Rosey Place will be an immersive experience into the company‚Äôs coastal rose-colored lifestyle that will showcase mindfully sourced local products including a rotating collaborative collection of vintage furniture and home products by Yelp‚Äôs #1 vintage shop in the United States, Bad Madge & Co of South Park. The Rosey Place will expand its brand awareness through new digital sales channels and establish a testing and launching pad for the company‚Äôs future lifestyle products. During this time, the company is seeking to continue to research and develop innovations in corporate responsibility, ethical product development, mindfulness and conscious consumerism advocacy, and mindful community building. The company will explore strategies to leverage experiential marketing, virtual reality, artificial intelligence, social media, proprietary web and mobile applications, and blockchain technology to expand reach and achieve its goals and visions. Target Market The company targets 20 to 30-something light-seeking dancefloor-hopping adventurers who strive to look upon every moment as they would a blossoming flower. The company‚Äôs true advocates are those who value mindfully made bespoke fashion, have a deep desire to maintain a rosy perspective between the glimpses in their adventures, and endeavor to live a purpose-driven and balanced life. History of Interest Inception Roseys‚Äô rose colored sunnies were first planted on Rosemont Street at Windansea Beach by Bethany Rose Cannon, an environmental scientist who, despite living next to the most epic sunset spot, struggled to keep peace and beauty in sight just as much as she struggled to find local fashion that takes responsibility to protect the coast that we‚Äôre meant to enjoy it on. Between feeling the weight of the world post-college, unexpected loss, and working a high-demand office work I would chase happiness on the weekends. The rose-colored vision for the company began to sprout up in spring of 2017 when Bethany bought her first pair of rose-red sunglasses for Mustache Bash, a 70‚Äôs boogie down on Broadway Pier in downtown San Diego. The circle framed red lenses she sought out in a Hillcrest shop embodied the revolutionary coolness and nostalgia of the Flower Power era that propagated many blossoms of the mindfulness movement whose words would always show her a glimmer of how to maintain the sunset state of mind she chased. Unbeknownst to her, those rose-red lenses would transport her there when she stepped out onto the pier that weekend. That summer, the founder immersed herself in vipassana meditation, an ancient practice of learning to observe with compassion oneself and the world just as they are. Despite major shifts in her own perspective, she found even the westernized and clinically researched communications of these simple yet profound keys to mental wellbeing to be unpalatable to people in her life who she knew could greatly benefit from them. After many failed attempts to attract her depressed, anxious, and busy friends to get hooked on fascinating books and lectures on cutting edge neuroscience or the Buddha‚Äôs concept of suffering and path to end it, it dawned on her that the rose-colored experience could captivate their

Target Market The company targets 20 to 30 - something light - seeking dancefloor - hopping adventurers who strive to look upon every moment as they would a blossoming flower. T he company‚Äôs true advocates are those who value mindfully made bespoke fashion , have a deep desire to maintain a rosy perspective between the glimpses in their adventures , and endeavor to live a purpose -driven and balanced life. History of Interest Summary Inception Roseys‚Äô rose colored sunnies were first planted on Rosemont Street at Windansea Beach by Bethany Rose Cannon , an environmental scientist who, despite living next to the most epic sunset spot, struggled to keep peace and beauty in sight just as much as she struggled to find local fashion that takes responsibility to protect the coas t that we‚Äôre meant to enjoy it on . Th e rose-colored vision for the company began to sprout up in spring of 2017 when Bethany bought her first pair of rose-red sunglasses for Mustache Bash , a 70‚Äôs boogie down on Broadway Pier in downtown San Diego . The circle framed red lenses she sought out in a Hillcrest shop embodied the revolutionary coolness and nostalgia of the Flower Power era that propagated many blossoms of the mindfulness movement whose words would always show her a glimmer of how to maintain the sunset state of mind she chased . U nbeknownst to her, those rose-red lenses would transport her there when she stepped out onto the pier that weekend . That summer, the founder immersed herself in vipassana meditation, an ancient practice of learning to observe with compassion oneself and the world just as they a re. Despite major shifts in her own perspective, she found even the westernized and clinically researched communications of these simple yet profound keys to mental wellbeing to be unpalatable to people in her life who she knew could greatly benefit from them. After many failed attempts to attract her depressed , anxious , and busy friends to get hooked on fascinating books and lecture s on cutting edge neuroscience or the Buddha‚Äôs concept of suffering and path to end it, i t dawned on her that the rose-colored experience could captivate their attention and prove how peace and beauty are just a matter of perspective without saying a word. She would flip the old saying, take off your rose - colored glasses and show the world why we needed to put them on. History / connection In late 2017, after two years of burning out as an east coast field scientist turned west coast remote project manager and one perspective shifting summer ; her obsession over captivating others with the sunset blossoming effect of her favorite red sunglasses flourished into a business with a vision to make mindfulness and mindfully made products more accessible to her community and spread a revolution of mental wellbeing. Product Development & Market Validation Shortly a fter the business idea‚Äôs inception, the founder left her remote position to pursue her creative entrepreneurial dreams. The founder has developed and self-funded two small batch minimal viable product collections in retail and e-commerce to validate and analyze the market , grow a community and network , and deepen her understanding of her rose-colored philosophy. Each collection was designed with an engaging unboxing experience to share ancient teaching s from her mediation practice that led to profound shift s in her own perspective , allowing her to deepen her understanding and create a dialog around it in her community . The founder‚Äôs additional projects have allowed her to establish passive income while learning business skills , testing strategies, and developing a team to support her future development of Roseys. who was impeded to sell online due to the one-of-a-kind nature of her products and struggled to portray the social impact and her own hands-on involvement in her brand. 1.0 Collection In fall of 2017, Roseys Eyewear sprouted up in a small batch single style collection of circle framed Major Sunsets, named after the one of the first awe-inspired reactions from someone trying on her first pair of red sunglasses. The company‚Äôs founder first tested its rose-colored concept and ‚Äúsee the world bloom‚Äù philosophy online and from her backpack at music festivals, pool parties, yoga gatherings, and beyond to captivate blossoms in the moment and share a meditative practice that it‚Äôs possible to keep the peace and beauty of those peak experiences in sight, even when the Roseys come off. The first collection stemmed from the founder‚Äôs discovery of metta meditation, a practice of cultivating a sense of lovingkindness that shows how this warm regard for the world can be kindled in any moment and reverberates in the way we think and act. Each pair came with a guided metta meditation and origami paper with instructions on how to fold the origami rose that inspired the company‚Äôs logo. The origami would bloom from a box into a flower, showing how our loving awareness can unfold from the confines of ou r individual perspectives . The founder soon realized that the origami rose included six papers which she then used to represent the six steps in metta meditation , guiding blossoms to focus on each one as they folded and connect ing them online to teachers and books to learn more. Success and takeaways from collection became a locally recognizable symbol of love. During that time, the founder started up a successful Airbnb business in 2018 and outsourced operations to provide passive income as she developed the next collection of Roseys. 2.0 Collection In early 2019 , the founder teamed up with Danielle Vantini , a new friend who had recently moved to the United States from Brazil with a degree in marketing . She joined Roseys as a volunteer intern to apply her education , learn how to start her own business , and grow her network while completing an internship requirement for her marketing certificat e through UCSD ‚Äôs international education program . Danielle had the same deeply rooted desire to connect to her rose-colored perspective, but culturally had never heard of the expression ‚Äúto see through rose-colored glasses‚Äù which helped the company learn how to communicate its deeper message to a wider audience. Together they crafted a business plan to test and expand upon the company‚Äôs concept in a small batch collection of three unisex rose-colored styles. In spring of 2019 Danielle co-founded her own marketing agency and an international women entrepreneur community , Powerfuel Damas, which ha ve consulted with and support ed Roseys Eyewear ever since . At the end of 2019, w ith the help of Powerfuel Damas and collabo ration with several other local blossoms specializing in marketing , desig n, and product development; the company began to debut the 2.0 collection at local community gatherings and events focused on wellbeing and entrepreneurship. Roseys‚Äô second collection of rose-colored reminders share the awe of San Diego‚Äôs epic sunset beauty in three unisex styles that celebrate the founding of the rose-colored experience on the best coast. You can s ee the world bloom as you turn sundowns into Major Sunsets in Roseys‚Äô original rose colored frames that rock iconic circle lenses in honor of the transcendent minds, music, and style that grew from 1967‚Äôs Summer of Love and the Flower Power era; f eel your love blossom and remember everything‚Äôs calm under the Groovy Palms in our rosy revival of old school oval sunnies; a nd let it flourish in Sweet Swells as you conjure waves of love in our rose-colored rendition of retro cat eye sunnies. The 2.0 collection was created to bring the senses into the present, from the rose-colored experience to tactile velvet cases, to innovative sunglasses chains with essential oil diffusing rose blossoms, to an unboxing experience meticulously designed by the company‚Äôs founder to connect blossoms with the felt experience of their innate rosy awareness. Since the origami roses from the 1.0 collection proved to be too difficult for most and therefore wasteful, the company pocketed the idea and exchanged it for a mystical meditative scroll that would unroll from every pair. Each style comes attached to a See the World Bloom poem of mnemonic devices written and illustrated by the founder to show herself and others how a rose-colored perspective is always right between our ears. Each acronym in the poem reflects an illuminating foundational reflection used by world renown teachers and psychologists to show beginners how to cultivate mindfulness and compassion through vipassana m editation . Successes and takeways from 2.0 collection I saw there was really something to this rose-colored experience that captivated a much wider demographic than I expected. Through the pandemic the need for the deeper message has become even more relevant. In late 2020 , with her newly acquired skills in design and marketing, the founder began leading brand strategy and the expansion into e-commerce for Luna Wild Collection, a local successful social impact fashion brand and Roseys retailer with the same target market. 3.0 Collection This year, Roseys has been supported by a team of experienced mentors from long-established industry staples to grow into a mindful lifestyle brand and seed a rose-colored revolution by expanding into a collection of mindfully made rosey reminders for conscious closets and homes and a digital mediation community. Roseys is now working to expand the third generation into a mindful lifestyle brand through mindfully made experiential fashion and home products. As a former Environmental Scientist, Roseys' founder has dreams to grow sustainably and ethically. Roseys‚Äô Roadmap to Ultimate Goodness is underway to define what it means to be a company and product that's "radically good" for the people and planet through community collaboration with peers, mentors, industry experts, and a USCD Environmental Policy Student Intern. Since pivoting from her career as a scientist and testing the concept for Roseys Eyewear , the founder‚Äôs business experience involved owning and operating two Airbnb properties and managing digital operations and brand strategy for a local social impact clothing startup (and Roseys retailer) which will both support future growth of the company . Her prior professional experience include s managing complex environmental permitting projects, managing a storefront and digital operations for a green goods retail store, supporting New Hampshire State Conservationists at the United States‚Äô Department of Agriculture‚Äôs Natural Resource Conservation Service on conservation innovation research and land management, independent undergraduate research at the University of New Hampshire‚Äôs Freshwater Biology Laboratory; and a Bachelor of Science in Environmental Conservation and International Affairs from the University of New Hampshire, a nationally recognized leader of sust

Sending from my home coast in NE This is really where my passion for my rose-colored sunglasses came I was moving from Boston to San Diego 7 years ago this weeken d That winter Boston most snow Between the cabin fever, a tragic loss, I was really depressed and having a tough time I knew moving wouldn‚Äôt change how I felt and I made a note I was going to chase sunsets and the Buddha, knowing next to nothing about Buddhism It wasn‚Äôt until I started brainstorming what to share that I realized how roseys has been my way of committing to that . 12 years ago I was sitting right over there at this lake when jarad asked me where I saw myself in ten years and it was then I realized I wanted to help save the planet somehow. Our college UNH a top rated school for sustainability, just being a student there you‚Äôre aware of how much a community can do to innovate to leave a positive impact on the earth and live symbiotically with nature. 10 years ago I graduated with a degree in evnvironemntal conservation and intl affairs with a deep understanding for how global environmental progress can happen when everyone whose interests are at stake have a voice I worked at the usda and saw innovation and collaboration After a short stint at a green retail and desk work at a consulting firm I became a field scientist Inspired by entrepreneurs like Tim Ferris who share how they found their success Looking for something that could fill a need that created community identify and purpose When I discovered the sunset blossoming effect of red lenses They pointed to that sunset state of mind I finally learned how to connect to through a Buddhist lineage of meditation called vipassana , known in the west as insight or mindfulness. I saw how captivated people would be I wanted to share the rose colored experience to remind people of the wonder In front of us, how it can give us a fresh perspective , and how we can perpetuate that same benevolent and curious awareness about ourselves the world and all our troubles by intentionally focusing on positive feelings like lov ing kindness to require our habitual primal fight flight freeze instincts that cloud our minds with negativity and fear . Nuturing this kind open and accepting regard for my experiences has allowed me uncover a more connected understanding for myself and the world, leading to insights into what they truly need and what my best intentions could be to serve them. I found this practice after pouring through spiritual teacher after teacher, finding solace in my scientific mind through the buddhas systematic and self evident approaches to explaining it. No one cared But they loved my sunglasses No one wanted to listen to any of the perspective shifting lectures on compassion and the nature of suffering. But it‚Äôs really much simpler than all the talk

Hi Alexis! I graduated from UNH in 2013 with a BS in Environmental Conservation and International Affairs. After seeing all of the sustainability efforts and education programs on campus during my freshman year, I was inspired to change my major and the path of my future. I'm currently partnered with a director to produce a documentary about the inspiration, challenges, and optimism I've found along my journey to create a sustainable eyewear brand. We'll be filming in the area on Friday, September 9 and we would love to interview someone at UNH about the school's efforts and innovations in sustainability and film a quick tour around campus to tie into my story of inspiration. I'm reaching out to a few of my favorite professors and local mentors as well. As an optimist with a background in conservation, I know how people and businesses can lose hope for reducing their social and environmental impacts, so with the film, I want to share positive stories to bring to light the progress the world is making to empower businesses and consumers to live and act mindfully. Unlike most documentaries that demonize industry pollution, my film will focus on the solutions to foster industry-wide conversations that are, as I learned in my environmental policy courses, inclusive and respectful of all stakeholders. The film will be submitted to the San Diego Environmental Film Festival this October and others throughout next year. It will be used in a crowdfunding campaign to raise funding for research and development of a radically good product and an open-sourced corporate "Roadmap to Ultimate Goodness". After changing my major, I worked as an environmental scientist at the USDA NRCS right off campus, and later at a consulting firm for several years after graduating. I later moved to San Diego and started a rose-colored sunglasses brand in 2017 with a mission to spread awareness about mindfulness, compassion, and sustainability and show how they go hand in hand. I've built a team of industry mentors and partners who are helping me innovate and establish the brand with a mission to become radically good for the people and the planet. You can learn more about me on my LinkedIn here . I hope to hear from you soon! I'd love to hear about any thoughts you may have on being involved in both the film and the project. All the best, Bethany www.roseys.love | Bethany Rose Cannon Founder + Designer ROSEYS Eyewear 858.769.9097 San Diego @roseys_eyewear

Hi there! I‚Äôm a local business owner researching the potential for kelp as a new sustainable source material for my products. I found you in my research on local kelp projects, I would love to connect sometime to learn more about what you do! My business, Roseys Eyewear, is on a mission to spread an optimistic outlook on our ourselves and the world through mindfully made rose-colored sunglasses. I founded the company with a background as an Environmental Scientist and I‚Äôm currently partnered with several mentors from big eyewear brands to innovate in sustainable/ethical product development and establish the brand in the industry. I‚Äôm just starting to dive into kelp research so it would be great to have a quick chat to get some initial insight from local experts like you! Hope to hear from you soon! Keep blooming, Bethany Rose Cannon Founder Roseys Eyewear

What do you want her to tell people Follow up with interns - Hi Nico, Just following up to capture what we discussed. We‚Äôre unfortunately not going to be moving forward with the collaboration. I will contact the interns to let them know. In terms of what to tell other people, I would just state that we appreciate them offering up their time but at this point the project isn‚Äôt going to move forward due to other business priorities. We can coordinate separately on when and how to exchange equipment etc. I want you to know that I really value the time we had working together and I wish you all the best in what‚Äôs next for you . Bethany So I know this will be disappointing but I have decided I need to end our collaboration on this project , starting immediately Pause Directly back to- I have been evaluating how I‚Äôm spending my time and what the needs are going to be for this business accelerator and I needed to make a tough priority call and decided I can‚Äôt continue this collaboration with you. I really appreciate the work you‚Äôve done and everything we‚Äôve learned together, it‚Äôs just under the current conditions this whole thing just isn‚Äôt going to work out . I want you to know that I really valued our time working together and I wish you the best in what‚Äôs next for you. Pause I understand this is very difficult but the decision is final s o I suggest we get off the phone so you have more time to process this. Follow up I‚Äôll follow up with and email to coordinate on any things we‚Äôll need to exchange and what will happen next. Friends/ Qs Just don‚Äôt engage Look I‚Äôm just trying to compartmentalize this as a business conversation so I think it‚Äôs best we just keep it to that. Questions Look If upset/emotional I‚Äôll follow up with and email to coordinate on what will happen next. Effective immediately. Follow up with email ‚Äì set up getting shit back in a professional way after both of our conversations yesterday about Cindy and Shane it was clear to me that your vision for this is much different than mine , we are just not on the same pag e . the cooperation and flexibility that my business and this project requires is not coming naturally I‚Äôve tried my best but communications have been difficult I‚Äôve really tried super hard to be patient and work through it but I‚Äôve spent over three weeks full time away from my business es and racking up more expenses than I anticipated and I still feel like I don‚Äôt have a clear picture of what my time and financial commitment s will be going forward It has taken too much time and money already and I can‚Äôt be confident to go forward in the coming weeks with all of the uncertainty that surrounds the project still at this point I hoped our conversation before we left for Boston would pave the way for more understanding and flexibility to scale things back but it‚Äôs clear you need more time than I have to give I need to spend the rest of my weekend preparing for this presentation and we still don‚Äôt have equipment costs or a full plan so there‚Äôs no way I can commit to it I need to be fully involved in this however it comes together and the scope of what you‚Äôre aiming for is far beyond what I‚Äôm capable of I‚Äôve given this project three full weeks of my time and I don‚Äôt have any time left to try to make it work . There has been no indication that the scope can be lessened and I still don‚Äôt have a full idea of my time commitment in the coming weeks or the full costs While we seem to work better in person, a lot of the communications have been difficult , especially digitally, an d I have tried really hard to be patient and make it work but there is a lack of respect and social awareness that I can‚Äôt spend more time navigating I really gave this my best shot but I‚Äôm just not confident enough to invest the amount of time and money needed to go forward with this I really appreciate all the hard work you‚Äôve put in to trying to make this happen but the reality is I‚Äôm burnt out on time and money and have the biggest opportunity lined up that I can no longer jeopardize for something with such much complications and uncertainty Since I started this project earlier this year it‚Äôs purpose is to be a fun and exciting side project that is ancillary to my work and while I was willing to dive in more than I ever expected to help get things with you off the ground, I can‚Äôt commit to full time and I can‚Äôt trust that it‚Äôs going to be any different than it‚Äôs been It‚Äôs just not something I want to put effort into anymore I need to prioritize my businesse s and prepare for success in the accelerator There is has been too much uncertainty and complications alongside such a big opportunity and I can‚Äôt have that will carry over into the program when I‚Äôll have to be hustling to develop the business weekly With the amount of time I‚Äôve lost on my business plan the past three weeks , I can‚Äôt justify going forward with this from both a time and money standpoint I appreciate all of the time you put in on it but Im not able to take the next steps confidently and I don‚Äôt have any more time left to try to make it work After both of our conversations yesterday it‚Äôs just clear that we‚Äôre not on the same page with this project Up until this point I thought we could make it work and I really tried through a lot of stumbling but I can‚Äôt trust that it won‚Äôt take up all of my time going forward All of the time that I‚Äôve had to work on my business has been significantly taken over by this project and I just can‚Äôt risk setting aside moving things forward any longer While I think we do work well together when we‚Äôre in person there‚Äôs nothing that indicates to me that we won‚Äôt need to be in constant communication throughout the next five weeks and that‚Äôs not possible for me Nothing has shown me that decreasing the scope of this project and each interview is possible from your point of view either Last week I had brought this to your attention that there would need to be flexibility in the scope , clarity on my time , and allowance for my time working on my business. I‚Äôve really pushed myself to the very last minute to try to make this can work and have risked not being well prepared for the biggest opportunity of my life This has been the case for the past three weeks and I can‚Äôt put more time and money into it knowing I‚Äôll be taking even more risk s to my businesses and investing way more money than I would‚Äôve ever imagined on this project. At this point I need to be 100% focused on Roseys and Luna Wild business development a nd the success of this accelerator ‚Äî‚Äî Its clear that we‚Äôre still not on the same page I can‚Äôt leave editing and review solely up to you because it‚Äôs my story to tell I know this sucks but I just won‚Äôt have the time for it and I can‚Äôt trust any estimates on how things will go our scope is clearly over committed ‚Äì we haven‚Äôt even come up with a detailed schedul e and I still don‚Äôt know my time commitment needed for what you have planned There‚Äôs no reason for me to believe that suddenly everything is going to go smoothly and I‚Äôm not going to be involved We‚Äôve been working full time and I still feel like we‚Äôre not on the same page I‚Äôve talked about my time commitments and nothing has changed Our conversations yesterday have led me to see that we are not on the same page and this has happened repeatedly And any time we communicate over slack it is not productive or respectful and it‚Äôs really unacceptable and not something I can maneuver on a regular basis Nothing has changed in the amount of time that I‚Äôve need ed to commit to it. I know I‚Äôll need more time than we plan for and I don‚Äôt have it. I need to pause this project and wait until I have more mentorship on how to go forward. I really tried, it was really difficult for me and I wanted to make it work and I want ed to try. Cindy is the most important person of this film and I had to spend over an hour to convince you to film her during the only time she has available Shane was never agreed as an interviewee , I have never spoken to him and I had to spend hours convincing you that he is not a priority My role was not a priority It is clear that your vision for this is very different from mine This project is meant to represent my business and its future I really tried, there‚Äôs been repeated stumbling that I‚Äôve tried to work though When I look back at the three weeks I‚Äôve spent no time on my business or the airbnbs or luna wild. ‚Äî‚Äî- This is the scope I can agree to and the budget and I can‚Äôt order equipment until I have a full schedule of my time commitment for filming, editing and support I need to be there for the interviews I wanted to meet because I‚Äôm concerned about the scope of the project. And up until this point I‚Äôve spent almost my entire full time schedule on this and I can‚Äôt do that going forward. We need our sync ups to only take 15 mins. I‚Äôm trying to figure out if this is even feasible before ordering the equipment. Pause Total current project expenses and expected There‚Äôs just not enough time or money to get this done the way we have set out The time and money that went into filming were over what was anticipated and I continued to fall behind on my business development - I need to expect that this will be the case going forward and I can‚Äôt risk it going into these next few weeks I need to focus on this business and preparing for this accelerator It‚Äôs not just slack and in phone calls or meetings, it‚Äôs all the time of me trying to figure out how to work through when we‚Äôre not aligned, how to approach it, what to do - there‚Äôs a lot of time involved Anticipating conflict and push back I need to focus on other things Going to be expensive Still don‚Äôt know exactly what we need Still don‚Äôt have equipment list, flyer, landing page I just don‚Äôt have the confidence anymore that this is going to work out in way that allows me to work on my business I know if I had full time to commit to this project and working together we could do something great But I know that if it continues to be this much time im not going to be able to do what I need to do for the accelerator This project is to serve the business and not the other way around Im in a tough position of needing to make the call on what is a priority I haven‚Äôt even got to catch up with you on all the things we need to catch up on never mind my business plan and that‚Äôs a problem We need to agree on : Budget ‚Äì one camera , don‚Äôt have the budget Interviewees ‚Äì Ashley, Dani, Ellen, Cindy, Adam, Tanya Time commitment ‚Äì interviews only, set up time I need to know that you agree to this and that this is the plan and that this can‚Äôt change again About to rent a bunch of very expensive equipment Getting very expensive f rom time and money Don‚Äôt have time to give up ‚Äì have already taken over three weeks of my full time and that cannot be the case going forward Last week I barley had time to work on the most important part of my business and yesterday was caught up with hours of conversations that delayed it even further ‚Äì now I‚Äôm days away without having practiced or sent to mentors This is what I have to expect going forward so I need to cut back on the scope to avoid needing to stop the project all together Two very important things but the business plan will take priority If this gets to be too much I have to put the business first This has all been moving very fast which has caused disjointed communications and scope While we can dream to be on the big screens this is just a sample of what could be and we need to get it done in the time available The interview list we made until 3am is the closest thing we‚Äôve done to putting a scope on paper and I was too exhausted to bring up Tanya or my interviews and did not take it as a final as it was impromptu and sketched out very late at night When I agreed to mark and the others that was before knowing that every interview would take multiple days and hours I don‚Äôt feel comfortable including anyone that I haven‚Äôt met or discussed with in depth their relationship to my vision You have seen the truth of the interviews we‚Äôve done and how they‚Äôve spoken power to the story, the people on this list will as well and will be true to my story We have to make a plan and a scope I can‚Äôt do test shoots or set up I can only show up for the interview Even outside of the meetings I‚Äôm having to spend time on figuring out how to make it happen Can‚Äôt be sorting out what went wrong The whole purpose of the doc is to support the business and the business plan not the other way around Amount of time I‚Äôve given in the past 3 is more than possible need to know she can handle with out me Need to have a scope locked in now, we can‚Äôt change who I can only show up for the actual interviews These are the most important people for my documentary ‚Äì need to prioritize the integral parts of the story I need to tell to represent the brand Liability for equipment Computer - can‚Äôt do that

The Problem The homogonous black len s ed sunglasses of the world are so often lost or broken and yet their materials will live on in the earth for many lifetimes all w hile the global market is dominated by just a few major companies that control how and what eyewear is made. Meanwhile, p essimism is growing from the mental health epidemic and combined with the dire challenges of the climate crisis, positive outlooks and actions as younger businesses, consumers, and citizens of the world can often seem insurmountable. The solution is Roseys Eyewear. For stylish mindful adventurers, Roseys Eyewear is the only optics brand dedicated to propagating awareness and compassion by sharing visual reminders to look with love and innovating to become radically good for the people and the planet. The Opportunity Unlike the predictable, competitive, and unsustainable eyewear industry, Roseys creates sharable iconic rose-red sunnies to captivate the world with optimism while making mindful living and business more accessible for everyone through purpose-driven products, conscious community, and industry collaboration. The growing disconnection of the mental health cris i s is at the root of the growing social and environmental impacts of the fashion industry, so Roseys Eyewear is tackling the problem at both ends. While the desire for mental wellbeing has grown since 2020, some of the simplest yet impactful and scientifically proven methods of increasing meaning and wisdom in our day to day are lost behind walls of boredom , irresponsibility , skepticism, dogma, and an oversaturated market of unregulated wellness coaches. At the same time, the growing consumer and regulator demands for sustainable and ethical products from transparent supply chains is putting pressure on the eyewear industry to rapidly change the way they do business. While industry leaders may be able to out compete new players through existing supply chains, r etrofitting new high standards to existing business models and manufacturing partnerships will be a slow process ‚Äì impeding the ability for existing businesses in the industry to meet this demand and in turn, the ability to further stimulate demand for the better of the planet . Additionally, new businesses face the challenge of major upfront costs to plan how to become ‚Äúradically good‚Äù in the first place, pigeonholing them in traditional business practices and supply chains . Market Size The target market is stylish and adventurous M illennials and G en Z ers who value unique responsibly made fashion , mental wellbeing, and belonging to a cause and community that moves the world towards goodness. Based on the United States 2021 census, Millennials (1981- 1996) had a population of 72.19 million people and Generation Z had a population of 68.6 million people , combined at 140.79 million people . The global sunglasses market as of 2022 totaled $20.82 billion , with luxury eyewear at 18.9 billion.

Additional major sources of future revenue include mindful apparel and home products, documentary films to spread optimism, interactive art exhibits, a digital platform and mobile app to empower mental wellbeing, and later , B2B partnerships to distribute responsible materials and products to the industry. Competitive Edge Roseys Eyewear offers unique sunset blossoming sunglasses with rose-red lenses and a meditative product and unboxing experience to inspire wearers to look with love and create a dialogue around mental wellbeing and ethical fashion. Roseys are a sharable and giftable experience that perpetuate word of mouth advocacy on their own . Roseys stand out among the rest in the sunglasses industry with their radiant rose-red lenses. Through its unique product and brand experience, Roseys is establishing itself as a globally recognizable symbol of love, a thought leader in mental wellbeing, and a collective to support each other in maintaining that sunset state of mind, even when the glasses come off. The company is developing its next generation of products to pioneer sustainable, ethical, and transparent business practices in eyewear and share the hope with the world and the industry that its more possible now than ever by facilitating business collaboration and open sourcing business development for the greater good. The company is actively collaborating with local scientists and consultants to innovate radically good source materials and business practices with a plan to offer them to the industry to transform supply chains and demand, faster than existing infrastructure and market reliance allow s . Marketing and Sales Strategy Roseys ‚Äô digital go-to-market plan follows the inbound method of attracting, engaging, and delighting our target audience throughout the customer journey to grow a loyal brand advocate community .

The company is in the process of filming a documentary to share Roseys‚Äô vision to submit to film festivals and use for crowdfunding. The company is also developing plans for a podcast, interactive art exhibits, and events that explore what it means to see the world bloom.

In the industry, Roseys will foster a community over competition mentality in our interactions with other eyewear businesses to nurture collaboration and seed future B2B partnerships . ----------------------------- While this may seem optimistic, Roseys is much bigger than a sunglasses company, it‚Äôs customers see it as a movement that is changing the way they see the world .

For stylish mindful adventurers, Roseys Eyewear is the only optics brand dedicated to propagating awareness and compassion by sharing visual reminders to look with love and innovating to become radically good for the people and the planet.

Through two small self-funded product collections, the company has validated the market and established a strong brand identity as a recognizable symbol of love in local wellness and music scenes. The company‚Äôs goal is to become a global force for good, expanding into a radically good product line that exceeds industry standards for sustainability, ethics, and transparency by 2024. The enclosed plan models a high-level direct to consumer marketing and sales strategy, however the company is seeking guidance to develop a retail strategy. The marketing strategy for direct-to-consumer sales will involve growing RE‚Äôs digital funnel, developing its role as thought leader in ethical fashion and mindfulness, and launching a film to raise brand awareness and promote its crowdfunding campaign. RE plans to thrive in the luxury eyewear market through its unique sharable purpose-driven product, engaged digital community, advocacy, and commitment to radical responsibility, setting a new standard for what it means to be ethical, sustainable, and transparent as a business. The founder has formed strategic partnerships with both industry and meditation mentors, sourcing partners, retailers, ethics consultants, content creators, and conservationists to further develop its business model, plan, and supply chain to allow the company to become radically good for the people and the planet, expand its mindful community, and raise awareness for conscious consumerism and mental wellbeing. RE is currently planning to raise $150,000 through crowdfunding in early 2023 to develop and launch its MLP collection with six rose-colored styles with an estimated revenue of $360,000. The opportunity to apply to SDSI coincided with several developments that led RE to put the first draft of this vision on paper, but this plan is a preliminary framework. Over the coming weeks, RE will be developing the financial, fundraising, and go-to-market strategies in depth with its mentors and consultants to ground and refine it with experienced industry insight and incoming product development proposals.

I still see the appeal of a Tesla from design perspective but Elon Musk is just the poster-child of capitalism and is a really incredible marketing strategist ‚Äî not sure how helpful it is to your story and the legacy of Rosey‚Äôs.

Wherever and whenever we are, Roseys sunset blossoming lenses illuminate the wonder of golden hour, reminding us how it‚Äôs always just a matter of perspective to feel our love blossom and let it flourish. While it‚Äôs easy to watch the world wither and turn away from the weeds of fear‚Äôs greed, hatred, and delusion; cultivating the grounds of our innate loving awareness can allow us to #SeeTheWorldBloom naturally, so we may look with love‚Äôs generosity, kindness, and understanding ~ no matter where we direct our gaze. The #SeeTheWorldBloom Scroll is a poem of acronyms I wrote to remind myself and my blossoms how to tune into this rose colored point of view, even when the Roseys come off. Each acronym in the poem represents a contemplation rooted in foundational philosophies from the Theravada Buddhist meditation practices of: vipassanƒÅ (insight/mindfulness) to observe oneself and the world just as they are, and mettƒÅ (lovingkindness) to cultivate a habitual sense of benevolence. For decades, these ancient yet timeless tools have been studied in the east and brought to the west by psychologists and neuroscientists alike to share, research, and incorporate into clinical therapy to nourish mental wellbeing. Roseys is my dedication to exploring and sharing the world renown teachers and practices that show us how to tend to our mind‚Äôs garden, plant new seeds, grow them with habit, and watch wisdom bloom within. With every blossom, the world begins to flourish. üëÅüåéüåπ ‚ô• Ô∏è @bethanyrosecannon ~ Learn more about the science and practices behind cultivating loving awareness from: @jack_kornfield @tarabrach @sharon_salzberg @wakingupapp @babaramdass @insightmeditationsociety @spirit_rock @insightlameditation @soundstrue @greatergoodmag (DM your favs) ‚Äî- While it‚Äôs easy to watch the world wither and turn away from the weeds of fear‚Äôs greed, hatred and delusion, I believe by cultivating the grounds of our innate loving awareness we can begin to #SeeTheWorldBloom naturally, and look with love‚Äôs generosity, kindness, and understanding ~no matter where we direct our gaze. is a poem of mnemonic devices I created Roseys to plant seeds of myself and my blossoms to look with the wonder, perspective and love we feel for San Diego sunsets and remind #SeeTheWorldBloom Scroll to remind us how when the rose colored glasses come off. is a poem of mnemonic devices Each acronym in the poem is a contemplation rooted in the ancient yet timeless philosophies behind the Theravada Buddhist meditation practices of mettƒÅ (lovingkindness) and vipassanƒÅ (insight/mindfulness). these simple yet profound observations of mind allow us Gaze into each acronym in my guides to plant seeds of self-evidential truth so you may grow them with practice and watch their wisdom bloom within.

DANI INTERVIEW Brief background; how did you get to where you are today? Where did the idea for Powerfuel Damas come from? Why did you and Mayra start it? Community over competition is a common phrase you and Mayra spread through PD, where did it come from? Why is it important to share ? You‚Äôre the first person I heard put a name to doing good through business, how did this idea of social impact business become something you value and embed in your business? Do you think every business should have a social impact mission ? It can be challenging for businesses to live up to their social impact initiatives, as you‚Äôve seen with Roseys and other businesses we know, they can even slow and inhibit growth ‚Äì how do you think businesses can strike a balance between making a difference while also growing successfully? We all face challenges growing business es - w hat did the struggle feel like for you ? How do you overcome it? How can we overcome those feelings of guilt for not having the impact we dream of right away?

SDSI Accelerator Feedback Document Roseys INTAKE PANEL Presentation Time 15:00 Video Link https://us02web.zoom.us/rec/share/poPiHcS6Za4d044BXNBSSnROmltqligl8mE926dBVxPFJeipwKPR_AkPXCAwnAuE.H6lrZX8Bsw0uIOWk?startTime=1663696405000 Feedback: Bethany definitely is the secret sauce of Roseys! I would recommend implementing some legal protection. We can definitely help you with some structure and planning. Excellent presentation. Super tight. Highly competitive market and very early stage business. The presentation was great but taking it from concept to business will be tough with cheap knock offs and expensive ad cost. Could take off on tik tok if done well but ultimately building long term brand and product value will be the key to not be perceived as a potential temporary trend. A bit too early to be part of SDSI's mentorship program? Should get more real-world data/customer validation to inject into the business model and then come back for how to scale it? Very passionate and seems to have found a good niche, but concerned about scalability of the business. Great story with potential tie in to community and sustainability aspects to differentiate itself.  Is in very early stages so will need lots of advice and help. I hope there is room in the world for this business. The spirit and culture is nothing but positive.

Dear Prospective SDSI Mentor, Thank you for your interest in volunteering your time and expertise to mentor the next generation of innovative sports and active lifestyle (SAL) businesses.  Without you , t he SDSI Mentoring program s are not possible and we want to ensure you have necessary tools to be successful. SDSI Accelerator The SDSI Accelerator is a 20 week , intensive business accelerator program for growing SAL companies . It pairs qualified entrepreneurs with CEOs, finance, marketing and domain executives from leading SAL companies, for hands on mentoring. There is no cost to apply, but upon acceptance companies must become SDSI members to participate. The purpose of the SDSI Accelerator is to fine-tune company business plans and assist companies in creating sustainable and scalable business models. The SDSI Accelerator program equips graduates with (1) high quality connections, (2) a better understanding of one‚Äôs business and a (3) high quality articulation of their business value in the form of a 15-minute, 5-minute and elevator pitch that can then be taken into the community to help foster strategic partnerships and outside investment opportunities. Companies who are accepted work weekly with their mentoring team, convening every 6 weeks for each milestone to present their business opportunity to SDSI mentors for feedback. Mentoring occurs in stages, starting with the development of the 15-minute Business Presentation and then the creation of an Elevator Pitch and five minute ‚Äú Quick Pitch ‚Äù . CLARIFICATION ON FUNDING: The SDSI Accelerator Program is not an investment matching program . The goal is to help participants create sustainable and scalable businesses and be better positions for success in the future. SDSI Accelerator Mentors The mentors working with SDSI are experienced entrepreneurs and business leaders who have accomplished significant business successes and work with our companies on a volunteer basis . Mentors consist of Business Advisors and Domain Experts. Business Advisors have demonstrated experience as a C - l evel executive , founder, president, VP or senior director with significant business responsibility . Business Advisors understand financial reports (P& L, cash flow, income statements and valuation) and have experience raising capital, building a company through a significant growth phase , and in many investing and piloting an exit. Domain Experts have experience as a C-l evel executive, founder, president, VP or director with significant business responsibility and have specific expertise in areas including but not limited to; finance, marketing, branding, operations, e-commerce, raising capital , IP, supply chain , etc. Mentor Forums - It is SDSI‚Äôs intention that Business Advisors and Domain Experts work together to share id eas, strategies, best practices and problem solve. The SDSI Mentor Forums are periodically held throughout the Accelerator Class, as a place to collaborate, discuss each Accelerator company‚Äôs status and ask for support from your fellow mentors.  It also provides an opportunity for you to collaborate on the many non-SDSI initiatives you are engaged with outside of your mentoring commitments. Time Commitment - There are two levels of commitment as a mentor Panelists - Attend scheduled panels upon availability and participating in Q&A and Feedback. Each class has 4 panels over the course of the 20 week program. An active mentor is defined as attending 3 of the 4 panels. Joining a mentoring team: upon joining a company mentoring team, mentors must commit to week ly, 1-2 hour meetings with their company for the duration of the program . Additional email communication may be necessary. Company and Mentor matching It is SDSI ‚Äôs intention to match companies with mentors who have the most relevant experiences to their business. The Intake Panel provides an opportunity for all mentors to (1) meet the companies (2) evaluate coacha bility & business viability and (3) volunteer to join a mentoring team for a company they can bring value to . Upon acceptance into the SDSI Accelerator , each company is matched with a Business Advisor, Marketing / Branding Domain Expert , a Financial Domain Expert and a Legal Advisor. Additional Domain Experts may be added based on each company's individual needs . SDSI Accelerator Milestones Current and future program dates can be found on the SDSI website here . Application and Screening ‚Äì The application period generally spans 3-4 weeks and gives entrepreneurs time to complete the extensive application process which consists of an in-depth on-line application, a business plan deck, a short introductory video and an executive summary.  All applications are screened internally and the top companies are selected to present at the Intake panel. Intake Panel (15-Minute presentation #1) - Confirms acceptance into the SDSI Accelerator Program. Preliminarily accepted applicants give their 15-minute business presentation to a panel of potential mentors, followed by 10 minutes of Q&A to evaluate coachability, business model viability and market opportunity. If accepted, a mentoring team will be form including: a Business Advisor who will lead the mentoring team, a marketing domain expert, a finance domain expert and a high level legal advisor. Additional domain experts can be assigned as needed. Milestone Panel #2 ( 15 Minute Presentation ) - P articipants give further refined 15-minute business presentation to a panel of Business Advisors, Domain Experts and fellow participants. Presentation is followed by 1 5 minutes of Q&A and feedback. Additional domain experts may be assigned if needed. Milestone Panel #3 ( Workshop Panel ) - There are two options for how to use this panel.  The mentor group will determine if the entrepreneur needs further presentation practice and would like to present their 15 minute business plan deck again for feedback, or the group can choose a challenge or issue to workshop with additional mentors.   At this point in the process, it's expected that the business plans are in their strongest form and the company is ready to move on to working on the 5 Minute Quick Pitch.  At this panel, participants also present the first draft of their Elevator pitch. Milestone Panel #4 ( Quick Pitch/Elevator Pitch ) - Accelerator participants give elevator presentation to Business Advisors, Domain Experts and fellow Accelerator participants, as well as a 5 Minute business presentation with slides. Presentation is followed by 15 minutes of Q&A and discussion. Final Review - After the final panel, entrepreneurs will submit their 15-Minute business presentation, 5-Minute quick pitch, Due Diligence sign off and final Executive Summary for internal review by SDSI, with the help of the mentor team lead. Approval of these materials is required to be awarded the SDSI Accelerator Graduate badge . Milestone Expectations: While companies are expected to be prepared for the above panels as described , the below expectations must be met before moving on to the next panel. A company‚Äôs mentoring team reserves the right to hold a company back if they are not adequately prepared. 1. Before Presentation #2 - Review/develop the plan for product, competition, marketing etc. showing actuals to date and future potential with/without financing. 2.

SDSI Accelerator Program - Questions to Guide Your First Mentor Meeting The SDSI Accelerator program is a structured, yet flexible program that aims to assist businesses in various stages of scale.  In the first meeting it‚Äôs important for the team to align around the goals for the program and decide on the structure for organizing as you move forward over the 20 weeks of this program.  Generally, the mentor in the Business Advisor role serves as the lead to help guide conversations ‚Äì but this is not a hard and fast rule, please discuss with your mentor group to figure out what structure makes the most sense for how your team will run. Setting Your First Meeting All participants of your team, mentors and entrepreneur(s) are copied on your initial communication email.  Just reply all to start coordinating your first meeting.  If a team member is missing at your first meeting, make sure to brief them on what the team discusses and create a plan for how to involve them in the future.  Also, please keep in mind that the mentors in our program are volunteering their time, so work to find a meeting time and method that works favorably for everyone.  The SDSI conference room and Zoom account is available for your meetings pending availability. What To Discuss At Your First Meeting The most important thing to establish at your first meeting is the entrepreneur‚Äôs goals for this program.  You should also use this meeting to review the feedback from the Intake panel.  You may also want to consider questions such as: What is your goal for this 20 - week program?  What do you hope to have learned, strategized or accomplished by the final presentation ? Is there anything you wish you‚Äôd done better or differently in your Intake presentation? What about in QnA ? Better describe market /customer validation Better understanding of legal / strategic business protection against competition while supporting industry collaboration ‚Äì Better understanding of role/impact at scale Strategy for long term brand and product value ‚Äì anti-trend What part of your business do you feel you understand the best?  The least? How should we work together as team? What is everyone‚Äôs a vailability ? Is there any scheduled times that specific members will be unavailable? What tools will you use to collaborate as a t eam?  What is the best communication method for each person and how will you ready the presentation deck for each milestone panel? Many teams like to use a cloud sharing option like GDrive or Dropbox. Please note that often your legal advisor will not be involved on a week to week basis.  Make sure that you are connecting with them ASAP to start the due diligence process and ensure you receive due diligence sign off before the program ends. If you have any questions, have unresolvable availability issues within your team, or find you have the need for additional experts or resources, please let me know.  SDSI is group with a wealth of resources and knowledge, but we need to understand your needs in order to meet them!  We‚Äôre here for you! ~Dana and the SDSI Team

My guilt What do we do STWB What do I do about it? Answers Connect with people the most Emotions Understand the struggle not being a business Why it‚Äôs important and why it‚Äôs hard Why is it a problem real world info Theyre validating your personal experience Rejects the ideals Get to the point Why is it a problem real world info Theyre validating your personal experience Figuring it out Setting up the context They‚Äôre voices of support Emotion Pause Allow Question Accept The weight of the world Stwb ‚Äì negative flashes ‚Äì the guilt sets in positive ‚Äì but there‚Äôs been a huge uptick in businesses asking what do I do? As an environmental scientist in my 20s I really struggled with the guilt over bootstrap ping my sunglasses company knowing with next to no control over the inevitable environmental and social impacts in the manufacturing process . The guilt sets in What do I do about it Sure I could‚Äôve chased after funding and try to find a business partner or convince some local angel investors fund it , but I knew next to no one in San Diego, had never owned my own businesses, and was self taught in most of what I knew about starting a business. Dani Powerfuel Damas Networking Mentors They weren‚Äôt just any sunglasses, my idea was pretty unconventional so I was uncertain if I wanted to leave my entire career and commit. Plus I was terrified that outside interests could sway me from my vision to be true to the brand I envisioned and to challenge myself to make strides towards radical sustainability, ethics, and transparency with every collection. ROI Retrofitting values So I did my best to test the idea on the market. And it worked. Tagged photos Music videos Keep your eye on the horizon End ‚Äì me presenting It was a huge struggle create a product that took control of its environmental Struggle to find coastal brands that protect it Urgency for sustainability Ever since I learned about pollution and climate change when I was a kid , I‚Äôve felt this massive urgency to do something about it . I think we all feel it by now. The air we breathe, the water we drink ‚Äì cindy Ellen 3:40 ‚Äì how did it make you feel when you saw that? Struggle to make an impact ‚Äì hopelessness I had built my education and career as an environmental scientist but I felt no matter what I did in my job or in my life , the change just wasn‚Äôt going to be fast enough The problems seemed so bi g and loud and inevitable. Climate fatigue ‚Äì ellen - ocean optimism podcast Ellen 4:50 ‚Äì I think most people feel we‚Äôre screwed ; 6:00 is anything im doing making an impact? Does it even matter? Oo ep 2 - 8:00 ‚Äì defeating learning about threats to env ; until learning about ocean optimism Inaccessibility - big dreams, small steps Before I moved to San Diego, I stopped shopping all together. Living off hand-me-downs from my two sisters and the occasional colorful gift from my mom when I‚Äôd visit home in New Hampshire in the same old black pants and t-shirt. But there were times when I needed something in the moment , a sweatshirt on a cold day, a pair of sunglasses on a beach camping trip up north , or a pair of flip flops after they randomly broke . Anytime I walk into a surf shop, I check the tags, I look for the commitments , the offsets, or even just a statement about the footprint that the product left behind on the people and planet and some kind of vision and hope to do better in the future . Seven years ago, next to no one were acknowledging the elephant in the room. On those spur of the moment shopping trips , I felt this enormous g uilt and frustration - Why weren‚Äôt coastal fashion brand s taking more responsibility for the environment we‚Äôre meant to enjoy their products in ? Guilt doesn‚Äôt make you do better ‚Äì freezes you Change next time I do it as business Then one day there was this huge spark to create something bigger, louder, and tangible that could speak up for the immensity of the nature, wildlife, and humanity that doesn‚Äôt have a voice and empower the world with the hope we would need to overcome its destruction . it was my mission to do it right for the people and planet. But as a remote scientist in her mid-20‚Äôs, the huge vision had to start much smaller. I realized there are enormous roadblocks that inhibit new small businesses from taking action on reducing their impact, we‚Äôre not in control of every single piece E specially in an industry so dependent on technical expertise and expensive equipment I decided it was better to do something than nothing at all . First, I had to decide if I actually wanted to leave my career behind for the fashion world . S o I self-funded and designed my first collection to test the idea on the market. Take steps Be honest WHY Ever since learning about pollution and climate change, I‚Äôve always felt this huge urgency to do something about it and yet a massive sense of powerlessness. I built my education and career as an environmental scientist and yet, no matter where I worked or what I did as an individual, it felt like the change that was needed to save the planet just wasn‚Äôt going to be fast enough. Before I moved to San Diego, I stopped shopping for fashion all together. Living off hand-me-downs from my two sisters and the occasional colorful gift from my mom when I‚Äôd visit home in New Hampshire in the same old black pants and t-shirt. T here were times when I needed something in the moment and on those spur of the moment shopping trips , I felt this enormous guilt and frustration over my options. a sweatshirt on a cold day, a pair of sunglasses on a beach camping trip up north, or a pair of flip flops after they randomly broke. Anytime I walk into a surf shop, I check the tags, I look for the commitments, the offsets, or even just a statement about the footprint that the product left behind on the people and planet and some kind of vision and hope to do better in the future. Why weren‚Äôt coastal fashion brands taking more responsibility for the environment we‚Äôre meant to enjoy their products in? Guilt freezes Then one day there was this huge spark to create my own fashion brand and challenge myself to do what other brands weren‚Äôt. As a minimalist and scientist, I never imagined I get into fashion, but the product and its message were much greater than a passing trend. It was something I thought could speak up for the nature, wildlife, and people that don‚Äôt have a voice and empower the world with hope we would need to overcome their destruction. But I realized there are enormous roadblocks that inhibit new and existing businesses from taking action to reduce their impact .

At the time, I was seeing meditation and mindfulness brighten my own perspective, but all my favorite hour-long lectures from monks and scientists would bore my anxious and depressed friends. There was a moment, that I realized my favorite sunnies were already captivating people with that same sense of peace, and perhaps they could open the door for them to explore it. I couldn‚Äôt believe no one had ever tried to perfect this experience to connect people to this place, and being an optimist, I thought you know, I could totally do it. Red roses have always had a personal meaning to me. The color because of our Albanian heritage but my middle name, Rose, was the namesake of my grandmother, along with many others in my family Nana Rose always was (and still is) this deep source of love, respect, and strength for all of us, so it really seemed perfect to create Roseys to spread all of those things with the world.

Dear King Gizz ! I hope you all received your Roseys from Desert¬†Daze and are enjoying the bloom! I sent them as a thank you because your music has empowered my commitment to my mission to create a sustainable eyewear company that change s the way we see the world. I‚Äôve been making a documentary this year about overcoming the struggles of sustainability through community, music, and mindfulness - I'm wondering if you would be open to discuss featuring the Butterfly 3000 album as the soundtrack? While the film documents my journey as a solo entrepreneur, it is meant to amplify the global urgency and optimism for sustainability and ethics from consumers, to businesses, investors, regulators, and beyond. Every¬†scene is punctuated with local wildlife and outdoor videography and your audio artistry and visualized lyrics from Butterfly 3000 will make its impact exponential! The album has been the sole soundtrack and key motivator to my business development ( of Roseys' 3.0 collection!oddly enough) and as I was writing the outline of the story, I realized that every single song on the album melodically illustrates the story so beautifully. Below is a link to a (very) rough draft of the film concept and story arch along with a sketch of how each song would be showcased. The goal is to submit to San Diego‚Äôs Environmental Film Festival . The winner out of all categories will be screened at a fashion show at the ‚ÄúSourcing at Magic‚Äù conference in Las Vegas ( over 30,000 attendees expected).

Hello everyone , my name is Bethany Rose Cannon and I‚Äôm the founder of Roseys Eyewear , what I believe to be the world‚Äôs first sunglasses company dedicated to perfecting the rose-colored experience. While many have heard the optimistic saying ‚Äú to see the world through rose-colored glasses ‚Äù , fewer know it stems from the US Civil War era when they were prescribed to treat depression in soldiers or that there ‚Äô s ongoing research behind the benefits of changing the lenses we look through, both literally and figuratively. The first time I looked through a pair of rose-red lenses I was completely captivated by this unexpected new dimension of beautiful colors my eyes had never witnessed before and the inner experience of seeing the world anew . I‚Äôd share them with everyone I ‚Äôd meet and watch them spark the same pause that stops every San Diegan when the sun goes down It‚Äôs that grounded yet hopeful perspective that can blossom when we slow down to see reality illuminated with wonder and truly love what we see, clouds and all . As a mediator of eastern rooted practices who sees the western world suffer from a struggle to pause , I created Roseys a s an outward statement piece that points to an inner reminder that a sunset state of mind is as simple as putting on a pair of rose-colored sunnies . I believe that when we choose to look with love , we cultivate the grounds to act with love naturally. In response to the highly restricted manufacturing practices in the eyewear industry, Roseys is innovating with every collection to challenge what is possible in sustainability, transparency, and ethics, while thriving on the market and fostering collaboration over competition so we can see the world bloom before it withers. With such a mindful purpose and my background as an Environmental Scientist, I am dedicated to a triple bottom line that equally prioritizes people, planet, and profit as I establish Roseys as an industry and mentality disruptor. While the depth of our global wish for all beings to live a life well lived may exceed our reach as a fashion brand, Roseys early adopters have coined our rose-colored experience as a movement and a symbol to seed the world with radical goodness and let it flourish.

Scores See the world bloom with radical goodness = radical responsibility In both our minds and our actions.

Rachel: I am a visionary leader and innovator in the sustainability and circularity space, working to develop and drive comprehensive ESG strategies that create industry change . My background is wide reaching with expertise in the apparel industry including social impact and compliance, product development, manufacturing, sourcing, packaging engineering, operations, merchandising, and design. I have extensive knowledge and experience in developing and executing strategies based on SBTs and SDGs, building and leading effective teams, and improving profitability, utilizing change management techniques . My focus is on the sweet spot where business and planet priorities align. I am a compassionate and empathetic leader who realizes global change is needed. My personal goal is to humanize our supply chains by leveraging my connections in international supply chain capacity building programs and compliance. A passion for collaboration helps me create partnerships across all value chains to advance sustainability frameworks that engage, educate, and influence all levels of stakeholders. ME: Since eyewear is a highly technical industry with manufacturing controlled in large part by a few giant leaders, I am facing many bottlenecks in my ability to know, minimize, and eliminate social and environmental impacts in my supply chain. I have been working with industry/supply chain mentors and sustainability/ethics consultants to create a "roadmap to radical goodness" that maps out the steps I can take now and in the future to reach high standards for sustainability, ethics, and transparency and offset unavoidable impacts along the way. My goal in chatting with Rachel would be to hear any feedback, insight, or overarching philosophy she may have for me as I develop strategies to establish ESG values and milestones at the foundation of my 5 year business plan , form a mission to raise awareness and demand for "radically good" products through my brand, and facilitate collaboration in the industry to eliminate impacts. My plan Innovate with every collection Now Best available materials / factories R&D new materials Industry collaboration to drive lens demand Analysis, minimization, offset Next Each brand is nuanced No one right answer Specific to the brand 150 team members ‚Äì 1 employee They all have opinions Job to cultivate consistency, what we believe for the brand, might not be personal, but its what the brand stands for Define that first what does sustainability Outerknown ‚Äì focus on water , how does it improve water People planet first, positive change ; underneaththat , ultimate waste reduce, less , use best version What do you do on a day to day Two that execute Long term strategy on sustainability Research to defeine partners Executing strategy Compliance , improvement constant, design parameters, indexing greenhouse gas emissions, and goals for reductions A lot of following up ppt and copy, costings, reports, what makes sense, adopting and change management, leadership of why / educatioing on why theres a problem what were going t odo why were not doing other things, Circularity ‚Äì how  to action on it ; Parameters for design team ‚Äì all part of design team 55; designers Trifecta ‚Äì every product must have sustainability, meet needs for performance, stylish , aren‚Äôt all going to be 100% must be included Rather than profit margin by style, looking holistically ‚Äì weighing if one sells more and margin it offsets ; Set a list of what is sustainable Starting to measure impacts early will be helpful ; very difficult to get from the past; legal disclosures ‚Äì to uncover supply chain Know who youre working with and keep track How often are you innovating / improving ? Is there a rule of thumb for % of revenue to allocate to ESG ? initial impact analysis of materials/factories actual impact analysis R&D to improve / innovate Part of process its who we are, built into ethos We know we want do better ‚Äì clothing for positive change Find a way to afford and invest Whats your primary objective for the brand Alumininum , circularity ‚Äì youll do all of them OK Customer wont give you more credibility for doing all than a few awesome Focus on biggest impact We could offset emmsisions from material is 70% of emmssion ; Driving industry change / Supply chain chang e Partnering towards the goal ‚Äì more voices Look outside of sunglasses Other consumer goods made with same material that may have influence in tier 7 supply chain Who welse uses that substrate that want sto be more responsible Skull candy ‚Äì packaging ‚Äì electronics; sustainability; look outside the box Bikes aluminum Don‚Äôt be afraid to keep asking; everyone would ask didn‚Äôt have big units; Converted denim to organic- team couldn‚Äôt afford it, why wont they do it it‚Äôs the right thing to do, go back to the vendor, how much can you give me at the same price; maybe you have to start with 75 % , incremental and share what your goal is , be ok with that process Want textile to textile recycling ‚Äì but theres no one to do that, still have to everything by hand Grace to accept what it is We give ourselves that in the kitchen or gym, it‚Äôs a process For it to stick piece by piece How do you stay on top of what‚Äôs happening in the field -- Educational programs/ accelerator s/ or consultants to understand what steps to take when? How to sustainability ethos in marketing ? Customer / industry education What kinds of trends are you seeing

Last Friday I hosted a sneak peek of my documentary in the making #SeeTheWorldBloom! These 15 mins were only a mere sketch of my true visio n but it was a huge milestone for me to accomplish. Becoming accountability buddies with @ellen to submit films to @sdeff kickstarted my long awaited dreams to learn how to create and tell stories through video . If it wasn‚Äôt for the amazing community I‚Äôve found here , I know I would have given up at the countless hurdle s I faced to turn this thing into reality (because I tried) but instead I was so encouraged and determined to make it happen against ALL odd s, including editing the first cut on my own ‚Äî with the guidance of my editing guru @sd.ig I learned early on that most people have a plan for the story that will be told but I was actively searching for the story I wanted to tell and how my key players would tell it. The film would capture conversations I was having with key mentors, consultants, and community at the most pivotal moment of my business yet ‚Äì a time While I was sure I couldn‚Äôt lan, film, and edit in less than 5 months. forced me to immerse myself in every second of every interview the story and allo wed me to truly see the hopeful journeys of mindfulness and sustainability ‚Ä¶ I honestly didn‚Äôt know if I would have a film ready that I was actually proud to show, but in a matter of days (and a couple sleepless nights) I cut down 40 mins to 20 At the beginning of 2022 Ellen and I made a pact to learn how to make films. This past June we attended a fundraiser for San Diego‚Äôs first environmental film festival and decided , we should make films. While th ese 20 melodic mins of mysterious blossoming similes and optimistic expertise were just a mere sketch of the creative volcano about to erupt into the multiverse (and gizzaverse ?!) submitting to @sdefforg and premiering with Powerfuel Damas were enormous milestones for me. Not only did I exceed my 2022 dreams of learning how to produce a film but this first little glimpse I created encapsulated a vision and a story that I‚Äôve been searching for for over five years since the idea for Roseys took root. I‚Äôm so grateful for the community and accountability that made me commit to my milestones because if I didn‚Äôt feel so determined to make something come to life against ALL odds and decide to edit this first draft o n my own, I might not have discovered all the complex interweavings of the thread of the story that ties mindfulness and sustainability together through the rose colored experienc e and my own personal rose colored philosophy. This new vision will propel the 3.0 collection to new heights and embed it with so much meaning and purpose to spread # radicalgoodness with the world . They say in product dev if you‚Äôre not a little embarrassed by your v1, you launched it too late - so cheers to all of you for building such a badass garden of blossoms to make a premiere happen in the blink of an eye to force me to launch something and for bringing so much beauty and sunshine to my life that the weeds of the ego are completely irrelevant! Infinite love to you all! ‚Äî- It was hard for me to make friends when I moved here, and creating roseys has given me something to talk about and connect over with more passion and excitement than ever. I‚Äôm so happy to share this culmination of many years of dreaming, connecting, and finally figuring out how to use Adobe premiere. This is the first cut of a story I plan to expand and share next year to spread wonder, perspective, and love. I‚Äôm so grateful for the accountability because if I didn‚Äôt feel so determined to make something come to life against all odds , I might not have discovered a beautiful thread of a story that ties mindfulness and sustainability together through the rose colored experience . if I didn‚Äôt think the message was so urgent or feel so empowered to believe this project could come to life against all odds (including being a complete noob in filmmaking ) I would not have dedicated the hours I did to discovering every second of every interview and come to know the depths of the story that ties mindfulness and sustainability together through the rose colored experience It was an insane rollercoaster I feel like I finally have a story to tell. They say if you‚Äôre not a little embarrassed by your MVP ‚Äì you shipped it too late , so cheers to all of you for building a badass community together and for bringing so much beautiful sunshine and support to my life that the embarrassment is completely irrelevant! Infinite love to you all!

keep total sales
y1 564 pull back d2c, up wholesale
cut d2c in half
add 100k to wholesale - monthly added
% pattern make sense to steve
didnt change top line , will change bottom line

were in the 70% for gross profit, now in 60%s

tradeshows - bump up if doing wholesale;

commission - third party rep; or buyer that buys for chain of resorts and take commission better than having distributor unless distributor;

once you start going to tradeshows and meeting ppl, regional buyers/distributors with one sale you can get 100 stores but comes at cost; buyer 10%; distributer looking for price lower than wholesale so they can sell to ultimate retailer most expensive
with distributer theyll market and wharehouse your product; advertise bc they have to sell it 

once you talk to a retailer they could have a buyer who could have other partnerships

hope that buyer is in store 1/mo to check on display etc

good to get in with people that you trust 

benefit in educating staff on product benefits -in display

built from bottom up - we know how much were selling at each price; not because

-- update inventory tab


--
charlie
- schedule
- rep/local; probably selling comp, their energy and sales focus is on what gets reordered
- probably not upfront cost - just taking commission
- youd want to hold off until you cant do it anymore; your face in the stores w/ the buyers to get to know you
- tradeshows

- employee wholesale contractor/ go around to check in etc make sure ppl are happy

Hi team! Last week I shared with the team my thoughts on scaling and we discussed presenting my plan and objectives and asking for recommendations from the group. I know the goal is to have a clear agenda this Wednesday so I wanted to send a quick update with where I‚Äôm at in case anyone wants to comment before then. My current plan is to add a few local stores similar to my top seller, Bad Madge Vintage, through 2023 Q1 using my existing inventory to grow revenue to purchase product, expand wholesale, and kickoff a digital effort. Last Friday I had a call with my sourcing agent about developing a mid-priced quick-to-production collection (Collection 3) with best available options for ethics/sustainability/transparency using stock frames and *hopefully* lenses. This will allow me to grow through 2023 with a higher quality product to test in surf shops/ more commercial wholesale partners and have some capital to work with to scale my digital presence w hile I develop a more customized high -end ‚Äúradically good‚Äù product line to launch in 2024 (Collection 4). The attached presentation provides a summary of the above and asks the mentor group for recommendations to meet my wholesale objectives . The attached spreadsheet details my current wholesale and digital sales plan s that will segway 2023 into the goals we have in the proforma for 2024. A grassroots strategy is in the works, but I am awaiting a meeting with the brand that sells for me at all the big events. Below are some questions that came up for the workshop that I‚Äôm wondering if Charlie /Melissa can comment : How to find the right sales rep and what to expect/prepare for ? D oes the new retailer onboarding and the sales velocity for digital and wholesale make sense ? W hen stores are looking to buy /onboard new brands ? I included assumptions of March for spring, June for summer, and September for fall When should I hire a rep? My thought is to hire one as soon as I am ready to launch Collection 3 at surf shops / major commercial retailers to ensure they‚Äôre monitored closely for success and to allow my focus to shift to digital. What types of purchasing terms , quantities, frequency to expect from major retailers? For Collection 3 do I keep with the same styles, change, expand? Key topics for workshop: How to get in at stores I see as being key retailers How to best dovetail into digital Pros/cons of crowdfunding Some backup questions if more time allows : How do we dovetail from wholesale into digital ‚Äì how to articulate product differentiation online I also wanted to note, I‚Äôve had some tough family needs that I‚Äôve been juggling the past several weeks and it has taken me away from this more than I would ‚Äôve hope d . Thankfully everything should be settled for now and I‚Äôm looking forward to building this plan out for the final presentation! --- Schedule Hi all, I wanted to follow up with a couple notes on schedule for the coming weeks . I decided to go on a remote work trip with some fellow entrepreneur friends to Brazil 12/26 to 1/6 . For calls 8am-1pm PST would be preferred but I can make it work later if needed. 12/26 - 12/27 I will be available only by email.

Meeting notes for tanya Now that I have the ball rolling with Roseys, I will likely be ready to start fleshing out the business plan for Airbnb this spring. I had a photographer do a test shoot of my Airbnb to get ‚Äúbefore‚Äù photos I‚Äôve been talking with a local fulfilment center who is open to shipping one of a kind products, even large items like furniture He suggested working off of a pre-order model to eliminate storage costs but will also be quoting those He said once everything is ordered we would deliver the items and they would pack and ship them I‚Äôm wrapping up my business accelerator program that‚Äôs been preparing me to launch my new collection of Roseys and I‚Äôm researching options to source sustainable branded merch and decided I want to upcycle and I thought of you! I was wondering if you have any kind of apparel backstock that you‚Äôd be interested in collaborating on a small batch collection? I‚Äôve been talking with Thrifsty‚Äôs about doing branded embroidery work. I want to have a collection of cool vintage accessories I thought this could be a good way to hit two birds with one stone and start testing out the workflow for a future Airbnb collab.

Hi there! I've heard about SeaTrees through SDSI's accelerator program from Steven Wilcox at Parkit and my mentor Charlie Ninegar at Nixon. I'm interested in learning how to partner with my rose colored sunnies, Roseys Eyewear :) I have grown the business in retail but am developing a new website and campaign to ramp up digital presence. I am looking to partner with a marine focused non-profit to positively offset the company's impacts and promote with our new sustainability mission. The blue carbon projects and sustainability in the surf industry that SeaTrees is supporting seems to be in perfect alignment with my coastal San Diego brand and future plans . Along with reminding the world that a sunset state of mind is just a matter of perspective with Roseys, as an environmental scientist by training, it is my goal to make ocean friendly eyewear a reality in the near future . The monopolization and technicalities of the eyewear industry pose many challenges in getting there, but I have been making exciting progress behind the scenes. I would love to learn more about partnering as I innovate with each collection to make strides in responsible product development. I will be launching my next collection this summer with a major focus on this mission. I am interested specifically in supporting the kelp forest but if it makes sense to include other projects I am open to it. Hope to hear from you soon! Keep blooming, Bethany

## üìÑ The Problem.docx
**Source:** `C:\claude_home\onedrive_roseys\planning\2022\business-plan\sdsi\projects\final-5min pres\The Problem.docx`
**Date:** 2023-02-01

The Problem Boomers are the most qualified job candidates out there today, and employers can‚Äôt find them in the clutter of students and unfiltered resumes on existing job sites and in newspapers. No quality job site is focused on this key boomer demographic. The solution is BoomerJobs.com . It is a full service online career portal offering a powerful combination of services to employers seeking quality candidates from the baby-boomer demographic to meet the needs of their workforce. At the same time, it offers employment and networking opportunities to the boomer generation, and advertising links for all visitors to related products and services. The Opportunity Unlike the larger career sites whose primary target market is on the early career employee, BoomerJobs addresses the more mature employee market, focused on providing employers with the more experienced adult set of candidates, with a variety of backgrounds. The fact that the upper end of the demographic is reaching retirement age is creating a worker shortage now and into the foreseeable future. This creates an opportunity to penetrate and be a successful business in the field of online computer employment services, especially through implementing quality marketing and sales strategies in conjunction with corporate branding. For employers the company offers a full complement of services which are scalable to meet their employment needs. As a benefit also to the employer is the fact that the target demographic is considered a protected age class and posting jobs on the site makes a statement that the employer is actively seeking candidates of all ages. This is critical to their diversity and affirmative action plans. In net, the BoomerJobs opportunity is driven by the fact that every day, 10,000 more Americans turn 55. Annual household income exceeding $60,000 is the norm for people in this demographic, so they have disposable income. Employers are realizing that tapping into the strengths of these older workers is an excellent way to save on training and benefits costs. Market Size The target market is actually employers and advertisers who are attempting to capitalize on the baby-boomer demographic, which is approximately 76 million people strong , all the people born in the surge after WW2 (1946-1964). Recent studies by the Census Bureau and the Bureau of Labor Statistics assert that there are currently 50 million workers 45 and older in the labor force today. They also state that by 2008, 40% of the workforce will be baby-boomers (45-61) or older. Advertising to baby-boomers on this site is also part of the opportunity, to present to the generation with the largest amount of accumulated wealth in history, estimated at $7 trillion dollars, $2 trillion of which is considered disposable income . In October 2006, there were 2.5 million new help wanted ads posted on job search sites or through online newspaper ads, up 28% from a year ago . Business Model Our pricing guidelines represent a 40% reduction over the typical job site. Employer job openings start as low as $250.00 for a single position posting, with larger groups available for similar savings. All boomer job listing and networking services are free to the user. Advertising will also be a major source of revenue, due to the attractive targeted nature of the demographic. Boomer Business Value ‚Ä¢ Lower absenteeism ‚Ä¢ Punctuality ‚Ä¢ Less likelihood to change jobs ‚Ä¢ Commitment to quality ‚Ä¢ Superior customer service skills ‚Ä¢ Better people skills ‚Ä¢ More eager to learn new skills ‚Ä¢ Positive attitude Competitive Edge The larger better known companies tend to target primarily the "early career employee". The bulk of the smaller companies tend to focus on small niche markets. Thus our competitive advantage is that we concentrate on the larger boomer demographic, which is a large, well-defined, and growing market. We also differentiate ourselves from the rest because we offer a good value, approximately 40-50% less in our package pricing than the larger boards. We provide excellent customer service with a full line of employer services. In posting a job or advertising on our site employers make a diversity statement as they are actively seeking candidates in a protected age class. Marketing and Sales Strategy The BoomerJobs basic strategy is to build a relationship-oriented business through a site with quality content, good value, and excellent customer support for both employers and job candidates. This will lead to long-term relationships with both, making the site their portal of choice for employees and boomer career information, not single-visit deals. A key marketing objective will be to help all customers understand the value of the relationship. Our go-to-market strategy is comprised of direct sales and selective partnership agreements with the following objectives: ‚Ä¢ Boomer community involvement through providing free seminars and presentations ‚Ä¢ Involvement in associations: Chamber of commerce, ASBA, SBDC, etc. ‚Ä¢ Evolve BoomerJobs services to optimized levels to maximize profit and quality. ‚Ä¢ Networking via other experts in the career counseling community ‚Ä¢ Website advertising and search engine optimization ‚Ä¢ High profile interaction between our sales staff and our customers Through search engine optimization and search engine marketing, BoomerJobs will be strategically placed near the top of both Google and Yahoo search engines. Executive Team BoomerJobs.com is led by John T Entrepreneur, who has built two previous companies, and has prior experience with one of the larger existing sites, FollowerJobs.com. He also has a signed partner agreement with a major developer of job site software, Resumes Galore. Additional marketing and operational executives have been targeted for availability after funding. Financial Projections Financials ($ Thousands) 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 Revenues 0 21 4501 13597 19760 25620 Expenditures 75 442 3035 5467 7287 8880 Net (75) (422) 1467 8131 12473 16741 At this stage, a $200K angel investment is required to complete the roll-out beyond a single test metropolitan area, and achieve a breakeven in the financials as shown in the chart above. Market Segments ‚Ä¢ Individuals looking to either start their own business or improve their business planning skills and knowledge. ‚Ä¢ Smaller companies in need of an affordable resource to create an experienced and stable workforce. ‚Ä¢ Large corporations trying to maintain quality personnel in their workforce.

We can walk through it if you have any questions during our call! Here are my thoughts on this - not surprised she didn't see a strong direct return on social, typically paid social have a really low direct return, even through retargeting, but should have an influence on overall lift of sales on site through various channels. If she was just running paid social ads and nothing else (including email or SEM), then yeah - there wouldn't be much return there. My recommendation is to run paid social in conjunction with google ads - running acquisition and retargeting campaigns on both channels. With this product, social ads should be the best bet to drive traffic as it looks like it is geared to a younger demo who use social. Also, make sure you are capturing email addresses for new customers to send them an email , as i am sure you have already suggested. That should give you the most bang for your buck IMO.  With this strategy, look at how each channel is performing ensuring you are getting the CTR and traffic you want , but from a revenue stand point look at things more wholistically so see if you can see a lift. As far as recommended spend, I mean there are such low sales right now and it seems very little testing on marketing, so its hard to say what the spend will drive . I am more do what you are comfortable with and prove it out and then scale it up based on your results and move the money to the channels that are working. Some things to consider, is this a seasonal product?  I know it's rose colored lenses, so are they more requested in winter than summer? or visa versa? Maybe wait to spend when it is more towards peak season. Who can she use cheaply via social influencers? Might be worth reaching out to some people and seeding them product and a code to promote and see if they will post it . Maybe I am behind on this trend, but have you heard of the app BeReal? New social app taking #1 in app store - might be worth seeing if there is anything fun that can be done there (not sure if there are ads there yet, but maybe something cool to do via seeding product). If you need video or photography, my brother Riley just started his own creative agency doing just that. He can make ads for pretty cheap right now as he is just starting out: https://www.stereogramfilms.com/ He is still working on his website, but you can see a little of what he does there.

SDSI Accelerator Feedback Document Roseys MILESTONE PANEL #4 Presentation Time 5 Minutes Video Link https://us02web.zoom.us/rec/share/V7JOSm2y2aK5aWrbw8UudrWLnv9nax_y2JgAwWOY5Z5B1XCGj3MXLvcSEKAmc_xp.tVVtCUTSxwAmOIod?startTime=1674669359000 Feedback: Will take a lot of marketing effort and dollars for potential customers to understand how these glasses are not just cheap novelty glasses you can find for less than $10. One thing lacking in the presentation is the quality of these lenses and why rose colored glasses are beneficial (hopefully) for your eyes. Obviously we wouldn't want to learn that wearing these long term could harm your vision. Interesting concept. Would love to see how Bethany continues to use real world data to suss out if the market is interested in this concept. As for sustainability, I understand the intention, but she needs to focus on the story.  The price increase is dramatic so the reasoning needs to be clear. Really interesting pitch. I worry about what might happen if a big player like Ray Ban or even Blenders would introduce a line of red lens glasses to compete but if you succeed in other forms of differentiation such as your sustainable goals (love that) and showing that your lenses outperform copy cats, you will have a chance to win big with this. Great work! Good job, Bethany.  Now all you have to do is... go make this happen!  Good luck! My friends have an awesome and growing band called Rose Colored World ‚Äì (www.instagram.com/rcwofficial) If you‚Äôd be interested in connecting, reach out to me (Joshua)  joshua@edgetheorylabs.com and I can put you in touch MILESTONE PANEL #3 Video Link https://us02web.zoom.us/rec/share/MGCylR-DmvLYpfGN4AicvItDLWfjRrS1fdZplhKCIVrBef9HI9uemwAsnhzKGp6P.bCKPxXRRZ56YX0-P?startTime=1670953801000 Workshop Notes: Work the local angle with retail for a while - go with local boutiques over larger board shops People like to work with people they know and like - you‚Äôre SO much of the brand, leverage that as part of your launch pad Use your digital channel to really understand your customers - you can get a lot of data and information that way that can help you grow You‚Äôre an in an experimental phase - think of everything as fact finding and keep trying different angles Micro-influencer strategy could work well in the digital space - trade product for exposure.  We have a past Accelerator grad that‚Äôs recently created a grassroots influencer strategy that‚Äôs returned some really good exposure for him - let me know if you‚Äôd like to connect with Cristobal from Selk bags. Work a hybrid strategy - build your community on-line, and then bring that community into retail - if you help bring in traffic/support to local boutiques, they‚Äôll be more inclined to help you MILESTONE PANEL #2 Presentation Time Elevator: 1 minute | Presentation: 15 minutes Video Link https://us02web.zoom.us/rec/share/SJ1vUvFdqS8EEl47qAAfunfz2tUk8C8uP1heozakxGg8Ig2j31OunxUyR1GwCt1V.XQpxKq745OToNU5I?startTime=1667927610000 Feedback Elevator: Elevator pitch had good content but was a little long and read like a speech versus a conversation Aim to make the elevator pitch a bit shorter and more like something you‚Äôd use in conversation in real life.  A 1 minute quick pitch is something you‚Äôll find in the business world, but for the purposes of this program, we like to see you practice the kind of intro you‚Äôd use in real networking type situations - you never know who‚Äôll you‚Äôll meet - be prepared ;) Presentation: The presentation was good, but quite wordy. I love your natural cadence when you are answering questions, but this presentation felt like you were reading it all. Your natural speech draws people in more. :) Great story, slides and passion for the business! Main question is around competition and the marketing spend required to succeed in a crowded, fashion fickle category - work to better present this path in your presentation. Adding details on costs, manufacturing & distribution would be helpful, as would wrapping up with an ask or objective, so we know why they‚Äôre here. Very passionate leader and with a clear vision. The product roadmap slides are great. But generally the brand and business is still early on.  Would like to see more info on the business model to support the viability of this business and the products. INTAKE PANEL Presentation Time 15:00 Video Link https://us02web.zoom.us/rec/share/poPiHcS6Za4d044BXNBSSnROmltqligl8mE926dBVxPFJeipwKPR_AkPXCAwnAuE.H6lrZX8Bsw0uIOWk?startTime=1663696405000 Feedback: Bethany definitely is the secret sauce of Roseys! I would recommend implementing some legal protection. We can definitely help you with some structure and planning. Excellent presentation. Super tight. Highly competitive market and very early stage business. The presentation was great but taking it from concept to business will be tough with cheap knock offs and expensive ad cost. Could take off on tik tok if done well but ultimately building long term brand and product value will be the key to not be perceived as a potential temporary trend. A bit too early to be part of SDSI's mentorship program? Should get more real-world data/customer validation to inject into the business model and then come back for how to scale it? Very passionate and seems to have found a good niche, but concerned about scalability of the business. Great story with potential tie in to community and sustainability aspects to differentiate itself.  Is in very early stages so will need lots of advice and help. I hope there is room in the world for this business. The spirit and culture is nothing but positive. MILESTONE PANEL #4 Presentation Time Video Link Feedback: Nice work! My friends have an awesome and growing band called Rose Colored World ‚Äì (www.instagram.com/rcwofficial) If you‚Äôd be interested in connecting, reach out to me (Joshua)  joshua@edgetheorylabs.com and I can put you in touch

--AI Your email is well-written, and it clearly lays out your request, background, and why you're interested in connecting with the Huberman Lab. However, there are a few minor changes that you might consider to help make your email more concise, compelling, and professional. Here's a revised version: Subject: Request for Guidance: Optimal Lens Color for Positive Perspective Shift Dear Huberman Lab Team, I hope this message finds you well. I am an environmental scientist and entrepreneur working on an exciting project that intersects the fields of optics, neuroscience, and environmental sustainability. I've been inspired by your work and would love to seek your expertise. My project, Roseys Eyewear, involves developing a unique collection of sustainable sunglasses with rose-colored lenses. Our aim is to spread a global positive perspective shift, and we have already received enthusiastic responses in San Diego and beyond. Currently, we're in line to develop a custom lens with Zeiss, a world leader in lenses. They've analyzed our transmission curve, and now we're seeking advice on how to refine it for the best optical benefits. Here are a few specific questions that I hope you might be able to help answer: Are there any scientific truths behind the old sayings, "put on your rose-colored glasses" or "la vie en rose"? Can different lens colors have potential health benefits or psychological effects? Are there mental or physical health benefits associated with concentrated transmission in specific ranges of wavelengths? Are there any notable properties or effects related to these wavelength ranges: 380-440 and 590-780? Within the allowed light transmission range for sunglasses, are there any particularly beneficial ranges for daytime use? A bit about the project's background: I created Roseys Eyewear in response to a remarkable sunset effect I experienced with a specific shade of red lenses. The brand embodies the concept that adopting a rosey perspective can be as simple as donning a pair of rose-colored glasses. With this next collection, our mission is to expand the brand and resonate with the worldwide saying "to see the world through rose-colored glasses," promoting mental well-being accessibility. I have been fortunate to receive support and guidance from a network of industry mentors and consultants, many from San Diego's renowned active lifestyle brands and sustainability leaders. If you're open to a collaboration or simply providing some advice, I'd be more than happy to share our detailed transmission report and any additional information you might need. Thank you for considering this request. I'm eager to hear back from you and potentially contribute to the understanding and application of color optics in an innovative, sustainable way. Best regards, Bethany --ME Hello Huberman Lab! Thank you for all you share! I am an environmental scientist and entrepreneur researching lens color for my next collection of radically sustainable rose colored sunnies to spread a global positive perspective shift. I would love to connect with the lab or Dr. Huberman himself to advise on my unique lens color that has taken off in San Diego and beyond as Roseys Eyewear. I am officially in line to develop a custom lens with Zeiss, a world leader in lenses. They have analyzed my transmission curve and I am eager to get expertise to advise on how to tweak the effects for optimal optical benefit. Below are some questions I have, I just submitted them to the QA for todays podcast which inspired me to finally reach out. 1) Any truth to the old sayings, put on your rose colored glasses? La vie en rose? Any insight on the health benefits of rose colored glasses that create a pink or red effect? Other colors? Is ‚Äúcolor therapy‚Äù real? 2) Any obvious health benefits (mental or physical) of concentrated transmission in specific ranges of wavelengths? 3) Anything interesting about these ranges?380-440590-780 4) Within the allowed light transmission range for sunglasses, are there any interesting ranges optimal for daytime use beyond what is typical? A brief background on me and this project: I created the brand because I found a specific shade of red lenses that creates an awe inspiring sunset effect unlike any red lens I had tried. In 2017 I began to share them as a reminder that tuning into a rosey perspective is just as simple as putting on a pair of rose colored glasses. I held off on growing the brand until I could learn how to create my products with radical responsibility for the people and planet. After years of networking and development, I am now on a mission with the next collection¬†to grow the brand to become synonymous with the worldwide saying ‚Äúto see the world through rose colored glasses‚Äù as a global movement to increase accessibility to mental well-being for all. I have been supported by a large network of industry mentors and consultants with backgrounds at some of San Diego‚Äôs most respected active lifestyle brands including, RAEN, SPY, Nixon, Isle, Dragon, and prAna as well as leaders in sustainability and conservation with backgrounds at Hey Social Good, SeaTrees , Ocean Optimism, NOAA, Waitt Institute, and UCSD. I‚Äôd be happy to share the detailed breakdown transmission report if you are willing to collaborate in any way. Hope to hear from you soon! Keep blooming!Bethany

There is a new AI tool that creates presentations from a short description of maximum 5000 characters. Can you help create a description for my kick off meeting with my new project manager based on the below job posting, correspondence and my summary of my projects and goals? Job posting: I am looking to hire a project manager with expertise as a digital strategist to support the scaling of two San Diego based fashion brands. I am the founder of a fashion and lifestyle brand and manage digital operations for a successful sustainable fashion brand. Both brands are at a pivotal moment in their growth and I am working on plans to scale both in wholesale and direct-to-consumer. I plan to redesign both websites and re-launch on Shopify with refreshed mission, vision, and product lines, begin testing and scaling paid ads, and ramp up digital presence. I also own and manage two Airbnb properties that may require a minor support role. I'm looking for a project manager who can work with me at a high level to plan goals/milestones, prioritize/delegate tasks, while keeping projects on task and providing recommendations and strategies to optimize workflows and increase project success. I see myself as a major bottleneck in the productivity and efficiency in keeping my projects moving and am eager to create a roadmap for these next efforts to be managed and delegated effectively. Ideally the project manager will also help me create a healthy workflow/balance for myself, identify needs/roles/budgets for support staff, and evaluate ROI on outsourcing. Experience in the following areas preferred, but I am open to hiring multiple roles so feel free to share where you think you could fit in best. - Shopify - Brand strategy - Digital marketing, advertising, PR - Affiliate/influencer/ambassador management - Brand and product launch - Agile planning / scrum master experience - Project scoping, budgeting, monitoring - Prioritzing and scheduling on an annual, quarterly, bi-weekly, and daily basis - Delegating, hiring, and managing virtual staff for support roles such as product management, digital marketing, content production - Experience in working with fashion/retail brands with sustainability, ethics, and transparency at the core of their ethos is preferred CORRESPONDENCE: Project manager: Hello. I have 16 years‚Äô experience in merchandising and product development, the last 6 as founder of my own e-commerce startup VacayStyle.com ran on Shopify. I also have my MBA from UCLA. I would love to help you with your project and as I am new to Upworks , I have set my fee low to gain consulting experience. Please see my attached resume for more information about my background. I look forward to hearing from you. Thank you! Founder: I'd like to start out with 4 hours per month and see what we can do together in that time to help move my projects forward. Below are the areas where I'd be interested in having your support in the near term: - guidance and accountability in preparing plans, strategies and setting up for success in acheiving milestones - ongoing support in managing/tracking all projects in clickup - hiring/overseeing virtual assistant(s) for time consuming tasks and content/social management - product development for Roseys I know you are a wealth of knowledge so I‚Äôm totally open to your suggestions on how we can make the most of our time. I envisioned most time to be spent in meetings together where we can develop strategies, plan, and follow up to track my progress and adapt along the way. In regards to my list, the first item is really what I‚Äôm looking for your support in, high level planning and strategy for the overall business. The last three are more so thoughts on some of my own near term priorities that I could use ongoing support on in the form of discussing strategy, needs, and key decisions and checking in on priorities and to keep me on track and accountable. Below are my thoughts on the structure for the first meeting. Tentative kick off meeting agenda: - review high level plans, goals, milestones for each swim lane of the business - answer questions - discuss high level strategy feedback/input - prioritize topics in need of more in depth discussion, strategy, and planning. I think for this and future meetings it would be best to keep things focused and have two separate meetings for Roseys and Luna Wild. Starting with Roseys. I was thinking 1.5-2 hours would do for each initial kickoff and am open to suggestions on that and any input on the agenda. I‚Äôm interested to hear your thoughts on all of the above! I think as we go over everything I will get a better idea of how things can flow going forward and what‚Äôs possible for our work together. I‚Äôm open to focusing some more hours upfront if needed to get us both on the same page and fleshing out plans that I can then move forward with your support. BUSINESS SUMMARY Product Development ‚Äì highest priority Timeline from now through December Near term priorities in summary Vintage deadstock frames sourcing New Italian made frames Lens development Pricing strategy Soon ‚Äì packaging design and sourcing Later ‚Äì sustainability offset Digital ‚Äì in progress as time allows Website migration to shopify Marketing , ads, PR, workflow in development and testing through Luna Wild Wholesale ‚Äì later Support current retailers Plans to expand boutique retail locations Identify high volume targets

And you would only have to deal with returns of a couple of specific items instead of any product in your collection. Easier to manage since those 1 or 3 will be the ones that are being returned the most (Excluding real returns) Eventually, having a try on virtually would be so cool.

Allocating resources and what do to in house Bobby ‚Äì content linked in, shared by steve https://www.linkedin.com/in/bobbydietz/ -- paid ads emails flows creative team ‚Äì performance ugc ( tiktok ) & existing content no one is hiring them to manage organic social drive down funnel -- Circle of everything that‚Äôs needed to work on d2c (ads, email Reddit, influencer youtube Good creative paid ads, emails to get ppl to come back LTV to CAC ratio What is that time frame How muchare they spending over 6 months When youre newer checking account is top of mind, building a brand and wont transact 2:1 the first month, maybe 3 months but perspective on time frame , need to know they‚Äôll come back Whats your budget Early stage ‚Äì treat ad buying process as 100k budget ‚Äì what would you do on site, product pages, if you were going to spend that much in the first month, thought to analyze product detail page on mobile, work with dev to make it just right ‚Äì that perspective is very helpful Continuing process, one way street Going to start spending on ads and that‚Äôs how im going to grow Not this isn‚Äôt working I need to take a break, it has to work, you have to keep going, momentum is everything, youre telling FB this isn‚Äôt working, if you run out of inventory, it can be desastorous for the progress youre trying to make ? ‚Äì if were spending 100k wed change a lot, production quality of content would be way better and match aspiring brands we hope to become. Do we just create one high quality video and keep feeding that (doing less and pushing harder or??) Fb is better for smaller budgets, google is different animal Shotgun ‚Äì people interested in festivals Fb is going to explore and figure out who is the right buyer Gif, video, boomerang, Show which works If you don‚Äôt have a good variety of ad copy and creative, you wont give the system enough to test and try If you make 10 diff ads, assume one will work really well You have to create more to test to find the second Then the third Each one of those videos will show you watch works and what doesn‚Äôt ‚Äì laundry brand, ROAS good on replacing your cologne, so you make more ads the same but different, guides product dev, scent boosted laundry Need a variety ‚Äì takes 9 touches for someone to convert just on google (not counting fb) all of those ads cant be the same High quality to show youre this legit company Shakey testimonial mobile High quality images after that to remind them its professional and well done Fast cuts loud music ? ‚Äì how do you calculate budget? 50 purchase conversions every 7 days per ad set Campaigns ‚Äì 3 ad sets, 3-5-7 ads Each ad set needs 50 conversions every 7 days If youre reverse engineering that‚Äôs where you start If product costs 50$ * 50 = budget Start lower just to test, if one ad looks good ill put more money on it Try to simplify what youre testing High quality video Testimonial handheld New campaign separate ad set Gifs vs images Don‚Äôt dilute small budget across too much stuff, need a variety of ads to test , see what resonates Facebook Campaign ‚Äì 100/day then facebook decides how to distribute within Ad set ‚Äì where you test interests, look alike, strategies for each ‚Äì ideally 50 conversions every 7 days per ad set ‚Äì if youre not getting close to that, you need to change from purchase objective to cart or lower quality view content (actions that youre giving fb to say are these the right buyers? The right people or not?) for the smallest budgets ‚Äì but ideally you use purchase objectives . If you don‚Äôt have the budget to do that for all three campaigns just do ones do you can know what doesn‚Äôt work. Better to know what doesn‚Äôt work. If no sales after two weeks. If spending 1000$/day and no momentum after two days, completely shut down and redo try something different. If its not converting at all, that‚Äôs an issue, could be a link or resonating messaging, tracking issue. If you see anything let it ride, when you launch facebook is trying to find the right audience, it might hit it right on the head directly, but then could go down because it could go down while it searches to find the right audience. Need to ride that so it can figure it out. 1000/day - 3 ad sets Testing specific interest, specific interest, vs broad 50 every 7 days is the standard for all companies that is set BY FACEBOOK ‚Äì that‚Äôs statistically significant to FB and pushes your ad in the algorithm Conversions ‚Äì 50 leads will get you consistent delivery because youre getting your goal achieved . Purchase campaign is expensive Traffic to product detail or sign up pages Get them to ad to cart or sign up , then have email flows Wont convert that well Not the goal Just to get momentum If you have  a budget for 6 months ‚Äì spend all that money in the first 6 weeks for a purchase campaign to see what is working or what doesn‚Äôt Steve - drop off for conversions is a ton ‚Äì 2% purchase, half the people who add to cart don‚Äôt buy (10% add to cart against conversions) ? ‚Äì doing more then 50 conversions per week but not paid, not everyone is, need to change what were getting out of our paid ads, 800$ product, cant spend that for CAC, do we set more achievable milestones like add to cart or click? Ad cost is lower that way , is that the only way for it to happen? Yes but Id say don‚Äôt use FB ads, put budget towards influencers Magic spoon - 50 influencers Send to influencer and its costing a lot less than paid ads Facebook is a one way street ‚Äì this is the direction of the company, you can‚Äôt stop it because it will lose momentum and not work ? ‚Äì 1500$/month on FB, is that worth it? Do I find more money to do a 6 week test? Minimal purchases on ads right now trying different things, what do you suggest? Not enough to do anything helpful in terms of conversions AOV 80$ 1500/80 = 15 conversions need WAY MORE What can you do to make the product more interesting Content collab to show product rather than paid media Collaboration with influencers to leverage their audiences Nich way down ‚Äì some of the best ‚Äì Urland crossfit audience, perhaps its good for pregnant women ‚Äì more specific and targeted Black craft cult ‚Äì gothic clothing ‚Äì hail satan ‚Äì people love it who want it ‚Äì the POLARIZING element ‚Äì this is for me ‚Äì it should be immediately obvious WHY as well Spending the time to build the story into the site is the best thing you can do , very hard Someone starting a notebook journal for all adults and kids ‚Äì no it should be for this SPECIFIC person and speak to that person exactly ‚Äì if you cant go to the masses you can find one group that you can identify with very strongly and SOLVE THEIR PROBLEMS (dean ‚Äì how are you going to get pics when surfing, perfect) Rather than going too broad and risk not identifying with someone, come back to them later on ? ‚Äì getting clicks from international is less expensive than domestic ‚Äì think of them as separate things how to strategize? How much value to put on that traffic if not leading to conversions? Everyone cares about US the most even oversees, UK must have discoutns , diff than US, focus on that its an enormous market with tons ready to buy ? ‚Äì broadest audience possible? Yes good strategy but need a big budget It needs to figure out the right people Leaning on the algorithm, need to stomach losses for 2 weeks or more Push away from that to see something really quick Small brands? Choose target audience? ‚Äì yes , target festivals etc ‚Äì 10M threshold ‚Äì if too small, add interests to get to 10M audience ‚Äì issue is you wont know which interest is performing well so you want to try to separate them out ‚Äì ad sets ‚Äì ME - ? ‚Äì focus on targeting clicks / followers?

It seems simple enough, but everyone tries to skip to the ‚Äòmake money‚Äô part. It doesn‚Äôt work. I tried. You need all the pieces. You need the stuff to sell - an offer. You need people to sell it to - leads. Then you gotta get those people to buy it - sales. Once you put all those in place, then you can make money. My first book, $100M Offers, covers the first step and gives you the stuff. It answers the age old question ‚ÄúWhat should I sell?.‚Äù Answer - an offer so good people feel stupid saying no. But strangers can only buy your stuff if they know you exist. This takes leads. ‚ÄúLeads‚Äù mean a lot of different things to a lot of different people. But most agree that they‚Äôre the first step to getting more customers. In simpler terms, it means they‚Äôve got the problem to solve and the money to spend. _'>-rr P¬ºt ___ _ S,-,,, .... 2 S,Tl'P $:t '3 -s.,-..., -. ~ -~ np -M: '5" ‚Ä¢He WAltlll 0...Tt<,-t‚Ä¢ Po~r feEE C.o"TE",.T Cot.I> 0...Tt<"t" ~u.i.> PA10 At>~ If you‚Äôre reading this book, you already know leads don‚Äôt magically appear. You need to go get them. More precisely, you need to help them find you so they can buy your stuff! And the best part is, you don‚Äôt have to wait‚Ä¶you can force them to find you. You do that through advertising. Advertising, the process of making known, lets strangers know about the stuff you sell. If more people know about the stuff you sell, then you sell more stuff. If you sell more stuff, then you make more money. Having lots of leads makes it hard to be poor. Advertising lets you have a terrible product... and still make money. It lets you be terrible at sales‚Ä¶and still make money. It lets you make a ton of mistakes and still. make. money. In short, having this skill gives you endless chances to get it right. And in the unforgiving world of business, second chances are hard to come by. So you might as well load up. Advertising is a skill worth having. And this book, $100M Leads, shows you exactly how to do it. *** $100M Leads sits atop the foundation of my first book, $100M Offers. It assumes you already have a Grand Slam Offer to sell - the stuff. Once you have an offer to sell, it creates the next problem‚ÄìWho do I sell it to? This book is my answer to that question. Leads. Lots of leads. And before you know how to get leads, life sucks. You don‚Äôt know where your next customer will come from. You scramble to cover rent and pay bills. You worry about laying people off, putting food on your table and‚Ä¶ going under. You work your hardest to succeed, and others laugh at you for trying. It feels like death. I‚Äôve been there. I get it. This book puts you in a better situation. One where you‚Äôve got more leads than you can handle and more money than you can spend. Here‚Äôs How: First, it explains how advertising works. Second, it reveals the four core ways to get leads. Third, it shows you how to get other people to do it for you. Finally, it wraps up with a one-page advertising plan you can use to grow your business today. *** Once you know how to get leads, life gets easier. As for why you should blindly listen to me about getting more leads - don‚Äôt. Make up your own darn mind! But, in the spirit of ‚Äúwalking the talk,‚Äù here‚Äôs my track record: I advertise in a variety of industries through my holding company Acquisition.com. Our portfolio includes software, e-commerce, business services, consumer services, brick & mortar chains, digital products, and plenty of others. Together, they make $250,000,000+ in annual revenue. And they do it by getting 20,000+ leads per day selling offers from $1 to $1,000,000+. On the personal side, I have a lifetime average return on advertising of 36:1. That means for every $1 I spend on advertising, I get $36 back. A return of 3600%. Some people built their wealth in the stock market. Others in real estate. I built mine advertising. This year I surpassed $100,000,000 in net worth at age 32. And if you‚Äôre from the future, that‚Äôs in 2022 US Dollars. Which, much to my dismay, came with no flyers. No awards. No parades. I‚Äôm still 2000x poorer than the richest man in the world. My life is pretty much the same. I‚Äôm still the same height, married to the same woman, and graying faster than when I was poor. In these pages, I share the skills responsible for the bulk of my material success. I did it all using the advertising methods in this book. I left nothing out. This isn‚Äôt a book of theories or armchair analysis. This book is built on what worked for me. And I wrote it hoping it‚Äôll work even better for you. To answer a question I got after releasing my first book: "Why do your books look like they‚Äôre written for kids?" The answer is simple: my books must be books I would read. And I have a short attention span. As such, I liken my reading preferences to that of a child: short in length, simple in words, and with lots of pictures. These books are my attempt to do that. $100M Leads is about getting strangers to show interest in the stuff you sell. And once I transfer that skill to you, it‚Äôs your turn to use it. With that out of the way‚Ä¶let's get rich, shall we? Pro Tip: Faster, Deeper Learning By Reading & Listening At Same Time Here's a life hack I stumbled on years ago. If you listen to an audiobook and read the physical book or ebook at the same time, you read faster and remember more. You store the contents in more places in your brain. Nifty stuff. This is how I read books worth reading. I also do both because I struggle to stay focused. If I listen to the audio while reading it helps me avoid zoning out. It took me two days to record this book out loud. I did it so if you struggle like me, you don't have to anymore. If you want to give it a try, go ahead and grab the audio version and see for yourself. I hope you find it as valuable as I have. I figured I'd put this "hack" early on. This way you'd have a chance to do it if you found the first chapter valuable enough to earn your attention. Pro Tip: Hack For Finishing Books I get distracted easily. So I need little tricks to keep my attention. This one helps me a lot: Finish chapters. Don't stop in the middle. Completing a chapter gives you positive reinforcement. It keeps you going. So, if you meet a tough chapter, finish it so you can start fresh on the next one. How I Got Here ‚ÄúHope is being able to see the light despite all the darkness‚Äù - Desmond Tutu March 2017. I felt hurried taps on my shoulder while working at my desk. It was Leila, my (then) girlfriend and business partner. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs up? You alright?‚Äù ‚ÄúWe have a problem.‚Äù She said. What now? I thought. ‚ÄúLook at this.‚Äù She shoved a stack of books out of the way to make room for her laptop. ‚ÄúWhat am I looking at?‚Äù I squinted. ‚ÄúA disaster.‚Äù She ran her finger down the screen to direct my gaze. -$99‚Ä¶ -$499‚Ä¶-$499‚Ä¶ -$299‚Ä¶-$399‚Ä¶ -$499‚Ä¶-$499‚Ä¶ Every other number was more than my rent. ‚ÄúWhat are these?‚Äù She started scrolling. ‚ÄúRefunds. All of them. From the two gyms we launched last month.‚Äù ‚ÄúWait. How? Why?‚Äù She scrolled more. ‚ÄúI got lots of weird texts last night from the members we sold at the Kentucky gym. I guess the owner stood up on a chair and told everyone to refund and go home. He didn‚Äôt want to deal with all the new customers.‚Äù "That's insane," I said. She was still scrolling. "Yeah, and the other gym owner told his new customers he would take them for half price if they asked for refunds from us and paid him instead.‚Äù ‚ÄúWait what? They can‚Äôt do that.‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúWell, they did.‚Äù She scrolled faster, the numbers blurred. ‚ÄúHave you called them? That‚Äôs not allowed in the agreement." I said. ‚ÄúYea. I know. They‚Äôre ignoring my calls.‚Äù I put my hand on hers. The refund waterfall froze in place. Hundreds of droplet-size reminders of how much I sucked. ‚ÄúHow bad is this? How many refunds? Just cutting profits? Or enough to go negative and owe money?‚Äù I tried to keep my voice steady. I failed. Leila paused before answering. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a hundred and fifty grand.‚Äù The number hung in the air. ‚Äú...we won‚Äôt be able to pay my friends.‚Äù Their faces flashed through my mind, and the little hope I had drained from my chest. A month earlier, I got her friends to quit their jobs for this. Now I had to tell them I didn‚Äôt have the money to pay them. She continued. ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt sell our way out of this either. It‚Äôll just create more refunds to deal with. And we‚Äôre out of money.‚Äù Her eyes met mine, looking for the answers she deserved. I had nothing. I felt sick. A year earlier- I was good at getting leads for my gyms. I scaled to five locations in only three years. My claim to fame was opening my gyms up at full capacity on the first day. So, I opened as many as I could as fast as I could. My fast pace started getting attention. I got asked to speak at a conference about my advertising method. To me though, I didn‚Äôt think my process was special. I figured everyone was doing it. So, I walked through my presentation hoping I wasn‚Äôt boring the audience. They were silent. The moment I stepped off stage, a mob formed around me. They hurled questions at me left and right. I could barely keep up. They even followed me into the bathroom. I felt like a celebrity. It was wild. To this day, I‚Äôve never been more bombarded in my life. Everyone wanted me to teach them how to do what I had just presented. They wanted my help. Me. But I had nothing to sell them. Although, over one hundred people left me their phone numbers and business cards in case I did. Then a wild idea came to me. I could make some money doing this‚Ä¶ 3 months later‚Äìan idea turns into a business Since I used advertising to launch my gyms at full capacity I thought, maybe, I could ‚Äúlaunch‚Äù other people‚Äôs gyms to full capacity, too. I called the company Gym Launch. Original, I know. My offer was simple. I‚Äôll fill your gym in 30 days for free. You pay nothing. I pay for everything. I sell new members and keep the first 6 weeks of membership fees as payment. You get everything else. If I don‚Äôt fill your gym, I don‚Äôt make money. You spend nothing either way. It was an easy offer to sell. I‚Äôd fly out. Turn on my lead machine. Work the leads. Then sell the leads. Except, instead of selling them into my gym, I‚Äôd sell them into whatever gym I was camped at for the month. Every month I‚Äôd go to a new gym. Rinse and repeat. It worked. Word of this kid who‚Äôd fill your gym for free got around fast. Unless I hired help, referrals would‚Äôve booked me out for more than two years straight. I couldn‚Äôt keep running my gyms and doing this, so I sold my gyms and went all in on Gym Launch. I saw a problem though. I filled their gyms, and they got to keep all the long-term profits. I left so much money on the table. But, if I were part owner of some of the gyms, I could stack revenue month over month. Bingo. Not much later, one of the gym owners made such an offer. We‚Äôd be fifty-fifty. I would fill the gym with members, and he would fill it with staff. With this new model, I could open up 1 to 2 gyms per month and own them all. This would work much better than only collecting the upfront cash. A win-win partnership. A slight hitch in the plan, though. My new partner had ‚Äúpoor financials.‚Äù So nice guy Alex offered to pay all the expenses and take on all the liability for the first launch. I personally guaranteed the lease and would spend my time and money to fill it with members. Once filled, I would hand the gym over to him. I put all the money from selling my gyms, including my life savings, into this "launch and go" model. It took everything I had. A few weeks later, halfway through the launch, I woke up to find all the money in the account gone. All of it. The partner accused me of stealing and took the money as ‚Äúhis share‚Äù of the profits. But, we hadn‚Äôt made any profit. Then, he sent the money to a foreign contact and filed for bankruptcy. That's what he told me anyway. When I offered to walk through the financials and account for every dollar, he refused. That‚Äôs when I knew I had made a terrible mistake. It turns out he had been indicted for fraud a few years earlier. And to make matters worse, I already knew. He told me it was ‚Äújust a big misunderstanding.‚Äù I believed him. As the saying goes, when money meets experience... the money gets the experience, and the experience gets the money. Lesson learned. In three months, I went from a successful multi-location gym owner. To selling all my gyms. To a cool new launching gyms thing. To completely broke. Everything I made from selling my gyms was gone. My life savings was gone. Wiped out. All of it. Four years of work, saving, sleeping on the floor‚Äì erased in a‚Ä¶oh no‚Ä¶ Leila. Leila quit her life as she knew it to do this with me. She weathered my constant changes. She supported me in the half-baked partnership even though she opposed it. Even with this huge failure, she never once even hinted, I told you so. Instead, she told me, ‚ÄúThe Gym Launch model is still good. Let‚Äôs do more of those.‚Äù So we d

ROSEYS X CUSTAMOR STRATEGY MAP INFORMATION SDSI Accelerator Deck Link , Executive Summary Link Note, these are a bit dated but provide a snapshot of the business and vision. Below are a some of the major changes. We had several different presentations for SDSI so this deck includes slides from each 2023 goals are now 2024 since my lens has taken a year to develop :/ This assumed a mass production product, now focused on vintage and lens replacement Product pricing will be more varied and skew higher with the focus on designer frames I felt the financial projections were a bit top down since I didn‚Äôt have a ton of information on my product offering yet, I‚Äôm working on updating this now and would love your input especially on strategy and resources to implement the initial launch. SKUs will be much higher. Since the frames will be largely ‚Äúone-of-a-kind‚Äù in the collection, I‚Äôm planning to look into a workaround to just make one sku and barcode for each frame style, material (metal, acetate, injection, other), possibly color, with variations for each unique frame. For glasses, w ith 9 styles and 4 material types it would be 37 base skus. If I made one for each color combination for 10 colors, I will need 360 skus. Plus added skus for other merch (see below). What have you purchased in frames and lenses for your new collection? What is on order? Vintage frame inventory spreadsheet This spreadsheet shows the fames I have on hand and on order with pricing I have about 35 frames on hand, 75 pending an order, with a wide variety of price points and styles. I plan to order more once I get a better vision of how my costs are coming together and I evaluate my target price points and styles I will focus on. With Ed & Sarna they will give me a 50% discount for at least 20 frames or more and 60% for around 70 frames or more Another vendor I met, Foto Venata Optico in Milan, is open to discussing providing frames on consignment. I have a range of styles I photographed from their shop. I have a few other backup vendors that do cheaper Asian made products and 100-200 MOQ designer products Do you still want to add other merchandise categories, i.e., apparel? Yes! Here is my list of thoughts on merch I could roll out with the launch Upcycled embroidered apparel and patches Blossom chains (collab with local jeweler who vends Roseys at festivals) Standalone cases Graphic prints L aunch date ‚Äì End of Spring 2024 (June) if all goes as planned with product development L ist your suppliers, what they supply, and lead times Ed & Sarna ‚Äì vintage frames 3 weeks for available frames listed on website or photos sent from backstock 1.5 month for specific styles sourced from their vendors (up to 1000 units) Zeiss ‚Äì custom tinted bio-nylon lenses Lead time varies and is updated regularly via email. Last update was 7 weeks. Eye Hub ‚Äì lens edge/mount/logo, packaging, lens repair/replace, fulfillment/returns Bulk lens mounting and packaging, about 2 weeks ( to be confirm ed ) I‚Äôm considering doing monthly small batch production to have a consistent flow of new designs to keep customers engaged and allow for a regular batch production schedule for lens replacements (see below). Repair/replacements will be a longer lead time starting off only because I‚Äôll need to do them with the bulk orders until I have enough ongoing volume to cover the set-up fees that are around $100-200 (to be confirmed). Product prints ‚Äì likely Greenfield paper Assuming 3 week lead time for new design, 2 for reorders (to be confirmed) Mailer/retail Boxes ‚Äì EcoEnclose Assuming 3 week lead time for new design, 2 for reorders (to be confirmed) Cases and pouches ‚Äì pending local design house in San Diego (to be confirmed soon) Assuming 1 month lead time for now Chains ‚Äì Grammatique (local jewelry designer) Likely a long lead time, 2 months for new design, 1 for reorders Embroidered upcycled merch ‚Äì Thriftsy‚Äôs Likely a long lead time, 2 months for new design, 1 for reorders Waiting to confirm if she can source thrifted apparel as well Can offer made to order embroidery, considering an option for customers to mail in their own clothing to be branded Projected balance and cashflow sheet P roduct Cost Spreadsheet 5 year P roforma (SDSI ) What is your average retail price? What is your average cost price and retail price? Do you have a current conversion rate for Insta?

This enhanced understanding can lead to better indexing and, potentially, to richer search results, known as "rich snippets," which display more information about the content directly in the search results (e.g., star ratings for reviews, prices for products, etc.). The schema markup tells search engines what your data means, not just what it says. For example, by using schema markup, you can tell search engines that a certain number on your page is the price of an item, that a certain string of text is the author of the article, or that a certain schedule refers to an upcoming event. Schema.org, a collaborative effort among Google, Bing, Yahoo, and Yandex, is the most common vocabulary used for this purpose. It offers a collection of shared vocabularies webmasters can use to mark up their pages in ways that can be understood by the major search engines.

My projects are managed in ClickUp where written and video project guidance is provided and timely asynchronous chat support is available in between meetings. While I do not have any W2 employees, I have a robust team of freelancers, vendors, partners, and local industry mentors who support the business and provide occasional opportunities for team collaboration.
