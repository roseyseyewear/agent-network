ADAM Can we get it to Cat 2 or 3 with drivable ? Of the stock Nylon polarized offering, the lightest tint is a category 2 lens and has a 31.38% light transmission, and the stock version of the samples sent are both category 1 and 44.82% (N5570) and 55.60% (NR150).   My assumption is with the amount of light being let in, eliminating glare might not be possible.  I checked the other materials in the Zeiss catalog, and none offer a light tint category 1 with polarization. Is it possible to offer polarization in a category 1 lens?  or is too much light being let in to reduce glare in a meaningful way? Transmission Do you have any docs that show the details of each region's driveability tests? Transmission tolerances to maintain significant blue blocking claims (XXX-XXX nm) 80? % Got it, the attached TDS is helpful.  The results on the N5570 TDS seem fairly ideal for us, kinda passing the global standards with the limitation of night driving for AU/NZ Polarization Is it possible to offer polarization in a category 1 lens?  or is too much light being let in to reduce glare in a meaningful way? ZG- So we currently have a CAT 1 in Light Pro, but its exclusive for another customer but let me check to see if the exclusivity is over and try and get a photo of it to show as I do not have a sample. I know I already asked at some points but is it possible to get any kind of exclusivity over the tints we develop? Can we say they are proprietary? Medical use FL-41 lens blocks 90% 480-520nm for light sensitivity, migraines, eyestrain, disorders Any idea if/how we can get this approved as a medical use? Waste Factory recycling – TDB Can we keep seconds so we can use them and they’re not used elsewhere? Low yield on RED – can we keep those that don’t pass QC? QC we work off an AQL 2,5 for our QC of mass production.  Attached is our product manual for the QC process.  All factories that we work with also have this manual. So if you end up working with a factory that we do not currently work with we will make sure they have it. EYE HUB Costs bulk pricing for lens edging she quoted $5-$8 depending on the frame and lens details Costs for bulk packaging and shipment (in a single bulk order and individual orders) logo logo R equirements for placement on the lens ? Could there be an additional logo on the inner lens ? design file requirements? Could the frame be marked in any way ? Sku /logo on arm, temple etc ? Any way for me to determine curve / thickness suitable for existing frame? ( eg , when I get samples sent to me to review before purchasing bulk) Any likely issues to run into replacing lenses in certain frames? Anything to look our for? Can users easily swap lenses back to originals themselves or need a shop to do it? Could I have users send their frames in directly to be replaced with my lenses and packaged with my packaging? What would be required? Do they keep scans for lens edging top re-create replacement lenses? Or would they need to be rescanned in person?

10 /20/23 – adam What do we do to make this happen? Understand the trade offs , Want the lenses and the defects Defects and imperfections in manufacturing are embraced My customers want imperfect defects, it is part of the story Variations in tint, spots, inclusions, are showcased This isn’t waste, it is part of the development process I w ant full exclusivity over the tint I have an existing business based on this exact tint the transmission curve can’t change (aside from starting at 400) I am scaling with this partnership and I intend for it to last the life of the business Industrialization must be a process that improves over time? It must take repetition to perfect outcome? Make my tint, do the industrialization run I accept all no matter what – at a discount until 70% reached s end good ones first, I sign off on QC, then send the rest ask for exclusivity Not es Gentle monster – discontinued non-driving not making bc it’s a challenge from a sales perspective – only do it for special request Nylon- eco product – high thresholds for eco certification Biochrome no one bought it Nike but that was it In theory it wouldn’t shock if that’s in the back of the mind of RD bc no one buys it – how much work PC lens to match blue of snow – push further not worried about nondriving in google Pushing to nondriving is not comfortable – PC – doesn’t work with acetate – bleeds color; risks exist Drill mount – lens only Assume we need to develop a tint based on material – nylon Alternatives develop PC tint and wait In parallel – honestly this is way more ideal – to avoid PELLETS :’’’’(((((( ask zeiss do they have deadstock plano lenses? Eco nylon – can we get it ? ask Patricia how to create a custom tint what kind of lens material can they tint ? (could we use hart’s blue blockers?) where can we find high quality deadstock blank plano lenses? Are PC lenses an issue to mount on any frame? Ask Ed and Sarna Do they have access to deadstock blank plano? Hart – broken heart story – let us finish See the world bloom 10/ 19 /23 - zeiss Original Can we darken color? Can we make 455-550 0%? If anything below 50% yield they wont If darker 10% jump more dyes, increase defects 4 base red samples – pa nr210 – darker than first – cat 3 – need technical data sheet - b est solution – will send to me Process of qualifying PC material for sustainable production – next year march April may – Nylon is more compatible all substrat es for frames PC starts at 380 but nylon starts at 400 Developed that was exclusive for a period of time – Need to industrialize it produce 500 pairs – determine the yield Qc – a b c zones – two black spots in a zone, etc , c zone – could change standard – if production is lower than 50% Could send scrap that don’t pass – dicey hard to manage to not mix lenses – could delay Dyes – variance on spectral curve – more complicated Signature tint – exclusivity – category 4 – small collection – possibility to do exclusivity Nr210 – blue 99% N513 – Driving – 9.50-10$ Pc – same concept as nylon – certification 6-8 months – redd cert takes time Lightpro - and polarize also going through it – in the process of being certified – film They say March – but don’t know for sure Exclusive? Low yield – 60 or 70 % yield – need Driving Darken appearance and tint
