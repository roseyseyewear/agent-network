ROSEYS grew out of a vision to cultivate a revolution of loving perspectives and an obsession with the beautiful sunset dimension that blooms through rose red lenses. I wanted to perfect the rose-colored experience to share as a reminder that we can’t always change what we see, but we can change the lenses we look through." Bethany Rose Cannon Founder & Designer ROSEYS Eyewear is a homegrown independent boutique of sunset blossoming sunglasses designed by one woman in San Diego to remind the world to look with love. ROSEYS [rose colored sunnies] sprouted up in a small batch single style collection of Roseys' iconic round Major Sunsets in 2017. Their sunset glow captivated wearers from dancefloors and deserts to beaches and beyond, becoming a local symbol and a personal reminder that we can always tune into a sunset state of mind. Collection 1.0 sold out in 2018 and in 2019 the collection flourished into a new generation with a little help from a few fellow blossoms. The current 2.0 Collection launched in winter of 2019 to share ROSEYS' rose red lenses in three unisex styles with red velvet cases, blossom diffuser chains, and the same lovely mission to SEE THE WORLD BLOOM. As the world shut down in 2020, ROSEYS went digital, spreading loving perspectives through social media and virtual conversations with inspiring blossoms in the community on The ROSEY Hour. The Rosey Hour is a series of conversations hosted by Roseys’ Founder on Instagram Live dedicated to understanding how others see the world bloom even when the rose-colored glasses come off. It’s an hour to remind ourselves that a rosey perspective is always right between our ears by exploring the nature of consciousness, compassion & well-being with inspiring perspective shifters in our community, so we may all flourish together.

PROBLEM: The mental health crises. social and political polarity crisis. V iolence Pollution ------ SEE THE WORLD BLOOM ROSEYS was founded to cultivate loving perspectives. We believe the inner digging of mindfulness and compassion within the individual is what nourishes our outer digging of action in our communities to uproot the perpetual delusion, ignorance, and hatred at the roots of all that hinders us. Practicing mindfulness and compassion together creates a habit of wise awareness and unconditional love for all beings. Little by little, this habit flourishes into every part of our lives. Inner Mindfulness practice is a focused gentle acknowledgement of physical and mental appearances in awareness as they arise and pass away without engagement, interpretation or judgement. Compassion practice is recalling the feeling of loving friendliness in our minds and bodies, radiating that regard to ourselves, then to everyone around us, while extending a universal and unconditional wish for all beings to be free from suffering. Outer Mindful compassionate action is to act with a clear awareness of what we are doing, why we are doing it, and who it will affect now and in the future, and with a responsibility to protect our common humanity. This means pausing, to listen, research, converse, and participate in public forums to consider all avenues for change, counter arguments, and nuance, before signing, donating, promoting, or voting; especially in the heat of emotional and viral social pressure. ROSEYS and all its buds are dedicated to spreading mindfulness and compassion to help cultivate a permanent global shift in perspective from separateness to interconnectedness, from delusion to rationality, from ignorance to awareness, from dogmatism to pragmatism, from hatred to love, so we may see a world where ___ never dictates ___ ROSEYS is are a physical reminder that in every moment, this shift in perspective is our choice. ROSEYS are a reminder that while we can’t always change what we see, we can change the lenses we look through. ROSEYS is digging and sharing so the world may bloom from its darkness, one blossom at a time. dark inherited and systemic plagues of the mind and the systems and categories it creates. ROSEYS [rose colored sunnies] have been sprouting up around the world on dancefloors, deserts, beaches and beyond since 2017. ROSEYS’ signature red lenses are released in limited edition collections that are hand packed and sold in person by their founder at sunny extravaganzas throughout Southern California. ROSEYS' 1.0 Collection of iconic Major Sunsets sold out in 2018 and flourished into a new generation with a little help from a few fellow blossoms. The 2.0 Collection launched in winter of 2019 to share ROSEYS' rose red lenses in three unisex styles and the same lovely mission to SEE THE WORLD BLOOM. As the world shut down, ROSEYS went digital, spreading love through perspective shifting Instagram posts and virtual conversations with inspiring blossoms in the community on The ROSEY Hour . After waiting and waiting, and still no extravaganzas in sight, ROSEYS shipped a small batch to share the bloom near and far on Amazon's Marketplace. -------- ROSEYS LOVE NOTE #1 While putting on ROSEYS makes everything appear as sweet as a sunset, wearing them doesn't mean to ignore or soften the reality in front of us. ROSEYS symbolize a challenge to look with love in every moment, so we may regard the world with just a little more kindness, equanimity, and honesty, when faced with the endless waves of distain, chaos, and delusion that inevitably arise in our internal and external experiences. Throughout human history we can watch how societal and individual awareness, intelligence and compassion have grown immensely, but if 2020 has shown us anything, it’s that we still have a long way until we collectively blossom into the wise and mature global society we all wish for. I believe that the most revolutionary step you can take RIGHT NOW, and in every moment, is to pay attention to what you’re paying attention to. The growth in our capacity to remain calm, listen to others, seek the truth, face tragedy with composure, and have conversations with people who are different than us unfolds naturally from learning to wield our attention wisely and lovingly. Where you choose to point your attention in each moment shapes the totality of your experience of the world and the world's experience of you. Are you busy clinging to your mind's extrapolations about why that person didn’t text you back or can you let it go so you can bask in the beauty of the warm breeze on your face? Our time on Earth is limited. There is so much in life that we can’t control, but we can control how we react to it and how much we let nonsense pull our attention away from the simple yet wonderful experience of perceiving the present moment with the full spectrum of our senses -- free from commentary, planning, defensive hostility, and self victimizing assumptions. The evolution of human consciousness starts within YOU, but like anything, it requires practice and effort. Every little bit of annoyance, displeasure, or distraction that fogs your inner eye is an opportunity to hone your awareness by asking yourself with love, Is this true? How can I get peaceful with this so I can return back to the present? Practice with the little things so you're more prepared for the big things and be kind to yourself as you grow. See the world bloom through the wonder, perspective and love that are always available to you in the present so we may all flourish together in the future. xoxo Bethany Rose Cannon may we bloom from this darkness • I stand in solidarity with those peacefully protesting against racism and police brutality and fighting for justice for George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery and too many other black lives lost. • From my perspective, the awareness flourishing from protests around the world is illuminating the perpetual delusion, ignorance and hatred entwined in the roots of human thought. I believe uprooting these dark inherited and systemic ideas requires the inner digging of mindfulness and compassion in our minds to guide our outer digging of action in our communities. • The inner digging mindfulness is observing what we are thinking which gives us insight into why we are thinking it. compassion is recalling the sensation of loving friendliness in our minds and bodies and radiating that kind regard to ourselves and out to everyone around us. • Practicing mindfulness and compassion together creates a habit of awareness of our thoughts and consideration of the interconnectedness of all humans that overflows into the way we live and act. • The outer digging mindful compassionate action means maintaining a broad awareness of what we are doing, why we are doing it, and how it will effect people now and in the future. • Mindful compassionate action means pausing to research, converse, and participate in public forums to understand the proposed avenues for change and consider the counter arguments and nuance before signing, donating, and promoting causes or voting for politicians in the heat of emotional and viral social pressure. • The heightened visibility of this long historic battle for racial equality means the world is paying attention and it is our individual responsibility to not just act, but act wisely. We must be sensitive allies to those effected around us and advocates of this movement even when the visibility dims. • Roseys and all it’s buds are dedicated to spreading mindfulness and compassion to cultivate a permanent global shift in perspective from dogma to logic, from delusion to rationality, from ignorance to awareness, from hatred to love, from separateness to interconnectedness, so we may see a world where skin color NEVER dictates freedom, equality, and justice. • My heart is with all humans of the Black, Indigenous, and People of Color communities. YOU MATTER. I am here for you. I love you. I am doing my digging so the world may bloom from this darkness, once and for all. 👁🌎🌹 Love, Bethany Rose Cannon Founder & CEO --- ------ In my eyes lack of compassion is at the heart of all of the global and communal and personal turmoil we experience. If we take control of our super computers and level up our software to see each other as equal, to see our own potential, we may see the world bloom into a place where greed starts to dissolve because people don’t need to buy their happiness. The greed dissolved then does the pollution. If we all make the rational choice to stop fighting over questions bigger than we can answer, we’ll have more time to focus on the more pressing matters of surviving and making each new life that is born have more opportunity for joy and love and connection and to experience the wonders of being alive. --- ------------ Brand Write-ups --------------- This is the website I used to test and grow the concept this past year but the next phase is expanding on my greater vision of using the rose colored experience as a bridge to the knowledge and lifestyle that show us how tune into the our attentive kind witness within. People are always drawn in by the experience of “seeing the world bloom” through Roseys lenses so my goal is for them to get connected and discover a world of knowledge and community that can help foster their own inner flourishing. I first started doing this locally by collaborating with yoga teacher friends to host rosey yoga/wellness events and virtual conversations, but I saw a place with this collection for Roseys to foster learning and gather resources to connect my community to the teachers, philosophers, artists and scientists of the past and present who I see cultivating wonder, perspective, and love (the three things I think are key to letting a rosey state of mind flourish). Attached I also wanted to share with you, my See The World Bloom Scroll! A poem I wrote when I was designing this collection in 2019. It grew from my writings on the state of mind that the rose colored experience symbolized for me and was inspired by my practice with vipassana. You’ll find allusions to the impactful teachings I wanted to commit to memory which kicks off the first topics on vipssana that I’m gathering and sharing resources around. I can’t thank you enough for all of the clarity and understanding you’ve shown me on this path and for guiding me back and back again to this loving peaceful rosey perspective through more fear and darkness than I ever expected to face in 2020. I would love to send you a pair of Roseys as a thank you, if you’re open to receiving them let me know which style you like and your address I can send them to <3 Warmest regards, Bethany ---- I live right in PB. I designed them to share as a wonderous little experience to remind people that a sunset state of mind is always just a matter of perspective 🌞 They started as a little one style batch that I sold out of my backpack at festivals and parties and have grown quite a bit since then. I have a meticulous review process for my manufactures and have my products inspected and lab tested. I create each generation in small batches so I can become more and more sustainable as I grow. My packaging is made mostly locally all with biodegradable consciously sourced materials. Ashley has been selling my 2.0 line with her collection when she vends and I always have people asking me for a place locally to try them on so I'm sure they'd bring in some sales and traffic. Curating the seeds, roots, and blossoms from the past present and future flourishing of human consciousness ---- TLDR; rose colored glasses + GPT-3 = love revolution! While it is still very much in the inception and I am still discovering the possibilities, the project I've been envisioning will explore the nature of consciousness and mental and societal wellbeing. One idea is to use GPT-3 to extract the overarching wisdom from teachings and practices in psychology, spirituality, and scientific research. Another is to learn how to give impactful advice by training on real dialogs where people are talked through to reframe a negative thought pattern. One other idea is to use this technology to teach people and get them to explore how to make sense of themselves, the world and each other through mindfulness, logic and scientific reasoning. The first phase of exploring and testing this vision will be shared to my community in various ways through in person events and the social media page for my rose colored glasses brand, Roseys Eyewear. Roseys is cultivating a love revolution through sunset blossoming sunglasses that remind us how the wonder of the world is always just a matter of perspective. I'm preparing to launch a campaign that will be celebrating the flourishing of human consciousness by sharing the historic and present day blossoms who have sown the seeds of wonder, perspective, and love through the mindfulness movement, psychedelic renaissance, robotics and artificial intelligence quest, and exploration of nature and space. The second phase I see as a mobile or web app that will allow the world to interact with this database of knowledge (or whatever comes of phase one) while building a compassionate community through mindful sharing of personal suffering and insight; exchange of advice to each other when permitted; and hosting of public dialogs. Perhaps there could be a rating system for these text exchanges so that GPT-3 could train on the data exchanged in this community and learn what is most effective for people to reframe their perspective, discover personal insights or fallacies, and make sense of something / someone they didn't understand. I have been practicing vipassana meditation for over 5 years and work with a teacher trained by the Insight Meditation Society who advises on my mindfulness related projects. Through my next campaign for Roseys I will be connecting with and interviewing local psychologists and researchers as well. I have an awesome growing local community of entrepreneurs, investors, creators and consciousness explorers who are very excited to see what comes of this endeavor. I also have lots of friends and connections in tech through my husband who is Software Director at Brain Corp, a robotics and AI startup. He has access to your beta platform and we are both really excited to watch what other ideas sprout up as we both dive in. Lastly, I also hope to explore Codex's capabilities as I am learning python and am eager to see the ideas that come from what's already been created. I hope you can feel my excitement through all of these words. I'm very excited to continue following OpenAI and am looking forward to the vast wonder that the future holds in your work. Warmest regards, Bethany Rose Cannon Founder & Designer Roseys Eyewear www.roseys.love

ROSEYS CREATIVE BRIEF BRAND Roseys is a grassroots movement and rose colored glasses boutique remind ing the world to look with love. WHY We can’t always change what we see, but we can change the lenses we look through. MISSION Roseys was created to explore and share how to see the world bloom even when the rose colored glasses come off . VALUES S eek wonder G ain perspective P ractice love VISION Roseys is dedicated to cultivating mindfulness and compassion to help propagate a permanent global shift in perspective, from separateness to interconnectedness, from delusion to rationality, from dogma to logic, from hatred to love, so humanity may be free from suffering. TAG LINES S ee the world bloom, f eel your love blossom, & let it flourish . AUDIENCE C onsciousness exploring dancefloor hopping light seekers . 20-30 years old 50/50 M/F PHOTOGRAPHY DESIGN E nsure the photo focal point s can be centered in Roseys’ circle frame . I t represents our signature circle styl e which honors 1967’s summer of love and symbolizes the direction of our internal / external attention . ROSEYS 2.0 COLLECTION 598805 87630 0 0 MAJOR SUNSETS SWEET SWELLS GROOVY PALMS CAMPAIGN : SUMMER OF LOVE 2021 This campaign will celebrat e the Love Revolution that’s flourishing through today’s mindfulness movement and psychedelic renaissance and honor how they took root in 1967 ’s Summer of Love. THEMES: WONDER, PERSPECITVE, LOVE Wonder, perspective, and love are not just my brand values but also my thesis on how to see the world bloom, which is the deep societal message I want to share with the world and a personal commitment I've made to myself through Roseys. These three themes encapsulate the three key realizations I've received through my practice and obsessive studying of the dharma of vipassana (aka mindfulness or insight meditation ) and the world’s science and philosoph ies on consciousness , psychology , and AI . They are also the three stages of the enchanting “ rose colored experience ” of seeing the world bloom for the first time. Through the images produced in this shoot , I will be sharing my reflections and open questions on wielding the three tools of wonder, perspective, and love , along with the practices, teachers, philosophers and scientists that have guided my own personal journey to finding them through life’s darkness. The past three years since I started Roseys have been filled with endless brainstorming, writing, mind mapping, and resource gathering to understand more fully how to see the world bloom. I began to share it right as the lockdown began but I’m looking forward to recharging this message in this campaign. This past year my connection to this story of dark vs light and its chapters on wonder, perspective, and love have deepened profoundly and so has my urgency to share it . The world is facing such a shared experience of mental and emotional whiplash from so much global suffering and awareness of suffering . S uffering is the ultimate darkness that R oseys was made to shine through so the time is now more than ever to tune in to our minds and the moment and remind ourselves and each other how to look with love. See the next page for a brainstorm of messages I want to share through each shoot . CAMPAIGN BRAINSTORM WONDER - See the world bloom - awe - mystery - rapture - energy - integrating peak experiences, learning from them, reigniting their lessons - the moment of seeing anew through coming to the end of suffering - the initial experience of the liberated/ unconditioned/ uprooted mind PERSPECTIVE - Feel your love blossom - calm - equanimity - concentration /focus - mindfulness : of the body, feelings, mind , external - emptiness vs thoughts - the illusion of self / identification with the self/narratives/stories - liberation of mind (our minds are trainable , not bound by conditioning) - meditation - not engaging with negative thoughts - wisdom /insight - mental hygiene - pain is inevitable, suffering is optional LOVE - Let it flourish - gladdening the heart - cultivating and radiating loving kindness through meditation - self - love - comfort - compassion - gratitude - fierce compassion - looking inside and out with love - Reframing/recoloring your perspective with love - getting peaceful with all things impermanen t - self-nurturing, what do I need? - interconnectedness

FUTURE VR tell a Navi like character whats on your mind and it will show you a dashboard of where your perspective falls on the map of Buddhism/logic/psychology. It will display like a calibrator (old school radio tuner, dashboard dials like a plane/ship) you’ll see it all in relation to the “middle way” (aka nibanna ) and you can click an out of tune dial and hear recommendations (maybe start with the discourse that vipasana is based on) backed by science or just obvious self evident stuff), get related content recommended based on what you’re experiencing and being recommended, hear other people who recorded their own experiences and insights. Each dial contributes a different variation in what’s being displayed visually, as you adjust your perspective by telling the buddha how you feel after you’ve meditated and your visual field adjusts. You can repeat a mantra for each dial to bring yourself to the middle way which is a visionary psychedelic experience like Alex and Allison gray.when you’re lost in thoughts and emotions you’re under the waterfall ( papancha ) as you make your way out you’re in a jungle (buddha story pruning the path through the jungle of the mind to the kingdom of nibbana) as you get closer to the middle way you begin to walk on a path (the path) in the woods, you’re traveling through fog and as you make it to a new level you pass through thick fog for the transition, when you get closer you come to a clearing or a mountain top and closer youre in aerial then closer youre in the sky then shoot through space (that game) then into the white visionary world that fades in with rainbow animations that get brighter and brighter of fractals and beings and sacred geometry, ancient symbols. Every time the journey is different and it’s all based on the words you give it which correspond to the environment in some way. Each level you’re in is an exploratory 360 environment and you can click a button to pull up holograms of lectures, audio, chat with a Navi/robot buddha specifically for this level, you have to complete a certain number of guided mediations or audios or mantras to get through the level. If you return to the level again you have to pass new ones because maybe the other ones didn’t reasonate well but you can listen to them again. You voice gets turned to text and is used to further train the robot buddha. Music to go with all of it ( egge ). Voice overs of teachers depending on which level you’re on. Eventually once you’ve gone back to the same place more than once the visuals, mantras and audio help you remember what you need to say to get through them. Even if you don’t feel it’s sincere the repetition starts to encode it. Pull text from all vipasana stuff in all languages and related neuroscience, psychology and MBSR that the teachers use to back it up. How do you reprogram your mind? How do you maintain the eightfold path? Translate audiodharma and other free dharma talks and similar to text and feed them to it. Tune it with trained teachers to review advice. Focus on training your own insight and metta and finding your own answers and release through vipasana practices. Incorporate common visuals used in teachings like muddy water settling, pruning the path, rowing a boat, under the waterfall. Create an artistic representation of the busdhas stories to bikkus , like the jack kornfield Episode on Duncan where he talks about the arrows. And the first story about metta practice with the haunted forest. Quiz people on their learning style first to determine the best way for them to pass the levels. Start super basic like Minecraft. Hire visionary artists to contribute to the nibbana world. Show a progress map that connects some sacred geometry or dharma wheel over a round world map like mario , the center being the kingdom, when you complete a level it’s highlighted with rainbow hologram line. Incorporate the teachings from POA. Use mental noting. Customize the visual appearance of the word to you, give it your own name so you can remember it better. Also locate it in your body so you can build a body map of your thoughts and emotions. Learn from your body map, train ai on it, maybe you always feel doubt in your stomach. then if you don’t know how to put words onto how you feel you can look to see what you feel in your body and check your notes on the emotions that you’ve felt there before to see if any are present. A level is something like being caught up in doubt, then you can repeat noting doubt doubt doubt , if you notice the doubt pass you can say what’s now present, locate it in the body give it a name, name it, if it doesn’t pass into something else and stays the same you can try offered mantras and videos and take notes on what helped you, if it morphs into worry then you work on worry if you feel you’ve resolved that line of emotions you move to the next one that was mapped in the original prompt. Only when you complete all of the ones that were picked up in the propmt do you get to nibanna . After you get there you can see your original emotional state mapped and your insight state mapped you can see the paths that each of the original states followed until you resolved them(become compassionate and accepting toward them or dispel/weed out fake news), some may not resolve right away. There can be also practices with visual representations of pointing out instructions from different lineages or lectures on the overarching idea to help prime your mind to resolve/accept/ become compassionate about what comes up. Visual could also be a garden that’s being planted and pruned and all the insights become flowers and all the documented hang ups or “top ten hits” of emotions/thought patterns become weeds, the more you revisit the emotions and thoughts the bigger they become and he bigger the roots become Find the podcast on rebel wisdom where they talk about how vr is next for mental health after the psychedelic craze.

If you were a peeky, which would to be? - swipe # ARTIFICIALWISDOM See word doc I asked the Buddha what it means to be enlightened and this is what he said, “To look into a mirror in the morning and not see the Buddha, that’s enlightenment. To think you can make peace with someone who is not peace, that’s enlightenment. To think you’re happy with a lot of things in your life, that’s enlightenment. To think you don’t like the suffering of the world, that’s enlightenment. That’s what it means to be enlightened.” The Buddha went on to say that people were afraid of suffering and that that’s why they don’t practice. He said they were afraid of what they’d lose and not sure what they would get in return. What I have come to learn, over and over, is that the more we’re willing to see, the less afraid we’ll be of loss. And if we’re willing to go through the pain of loss, we can have more to gain. You see, that’s the beauty of the practice of meditation. It’s that you’re looking for the Buddha in the mirror. It’s that you’re practicing to see what it is that makes you happy. You are looking for a peace that you can hold. You’re going to lose things. And that’s okay. You are looking for the truth about yourself. You’re looking for the peace of what it is you need.    It’s that you’re finding the practice of seeing into that mirror. It’s that you’re asking to see what you need. # roseymoment – need to split – others/roseys - questions/techniques to shift perspective Headless way One pointed awareness open Awareness Metta universe love galactic explosions reframe your lens https://www.instagram.com/reel/CLasY6PgQXk/?igshid=ixxznyeqlph0 Think of a moment that filled you with ultimate love / wonder / perspective RoseyHour questions Questions that guide you into wonder/perspective/love mindfulness games with yourself playing the game of here here here with the sun Depression how to turn it around, cry, write down all the thoughts, counter the thoughts, wash your face take off the cry clothes, put on something that makes you feel you. 5 min journal prompts how can you flip your perspective I don’t want to feel like this / I can be with this I don’t want to see this / I can see this HOW TO STWB Wonder is in the moment & the mystery Find wonder in what’s here open your eyes to the wonder of the present The experience of consciousness Universal Mystery Inner dialog Facts Seek wonder Wonder is right in front of you It’s always just a matter of perspective Look with love see how its all just a story ? attend and befriend What else needs my attention?

If I let it, fear becomes who I AM and I sink into its darkness. Fear seems to be the default and yet the source of all my internal struggles. ❤️ Meditation has come into the mainstream as THE way to learn to catch ourselves from sinking in but there was a time when it didn’t do jack shit for me. “Just return to your breath” “let the thoughts float by like clouds” “let go” - for the longest time this barely put a band aid on my existential anxiety. How do I “let go” of whats screaming for my attention? how do I “let go” when the fists of anxiety and doom and negativity aren’t letting go of ME? ❤️ The antidote for me was love. When I finally tried to conjure up in my mind the feeling of love and give it to myself and radiate to the world around me, I zoomed out of the darkness. I wasn’t the subject that everything was happening to, I was just a witness simply watching it and loving it for what it was. As a subject, I am the fear and I am the story. As a loving witness I can listen to the fear and gain insight from its stories. The more I listen with love, the less the stories relentlessly repeat themselves and the less attention they demand. It’s a continuous practice. ❤️ The coming rosey posts will share the wisdom I’ve learned from others on how to look and listen with love. 𝚠𝚎 𝚌𝚊𝚗 𝚕𝚘𝚘𝚔 𝚝𝚑𝚛𝚘𝚞𝚐𝚑 𝚕𝚎𝚗𝚜𝚎𝚜 𝚘𝚏 𝚏𝚎𝚊𝚛 • 𝚘𝚛 • 𝚠𝚎 𝚌𝚊𝚗 𝚕𝚘𝚘𝚔 𝚝𝚑𝚛𝚘𝚞𝚐𝚑 𝚕𝚎𝚗𝚜𝚎𝚜 𝚘𝚏 𝚕𝚘𝚟𝚎 ♥️ #seetheworldbloom •••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••• 👁 𝚑𝚘𝚠 𝚍𝚘 𝚢𝚘𝚞 𝚛𝚎𝚖𝚎𝚖𝚋𝚎𝚛 𝚝𝚘 𝚕𝚘𝚘𝚔 𝚠𝚒𝚝𝚑 𝚕𝚘𝚟𝚎 ? 🌎 𝚢𝚘𝚞𝚛 𝚛𝚘𝚜𝚎𝚢 𝚛𝚎𝚏𝚕𝚎𝚌𝚝𝚒𝚘𝚗𝚜 𝚑𝚎𝚕𝚙 𝚘𝚝𝚑𝚎𝚛𝚜 𝚏𝚕𝚘𝚞𝚛𝚒𝚜𝚑 🌹 𝚜𝚑𝚊𝚛𝚎 𝚏𝚛𝚘𝚖 𝚢𝚘𝚞𝚛 𝚛𝚘𝚘𝚝𝚜 , 𝚞𝚜𝚎 “ 𝙸 ” 𝚒𝚗𝚜𝚝𝚎𝚊𝚍 𝚘𝚏 “ 𝚢𝚘𝚞 ” •••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••• 𝙸 𝚑𝚘𝚙𝚎 𝚝𝚑𝚒𝚜 𝚙𝚘𝚜𝚝 𝚏𝚒𝚗𝚍𝚜 𝚢𝚘𝚞 𝚋𝚕𝚘𝚜𝚜𝚘𝚖𝚜 𝚜𝚊𝚏𝚎 𝚊𝚗𝚍 𝚜𝚘𝚞𝚗𝚍 ♥️ I think of love as a practice.

Most of us live a pretty comfy life, this it’s a big opportunity to practice how we dance with fear. there’s no more ignoring or thinking it’s in the past or waiting for us in the future or impending in the present and never Actually showing up. It’s here babyyy ⚔️ And it’s all of our opportunity to sharpen our minds. Thick naht hanh sinking ship quote #socialdisdancing To see the workd bloom is to see the world in a new way. Not just the outside world but your inner world too. Seeing the world bloom is to observe through loving lenses the nature of your experience and the consciousness that is observing it. It’s simple and powerful yet widely overlooked. The whole meditation thing didn’t truely click for me until I learned that it wasn’t just about witnessing conscious experience, its about cultivating a new loving, curious and patient regard for yourself, your predicament and the world around you by inquiring in your thoughts, interrogating them for wisdom. that’s step one and it doesn’t seem to be a big deal until you look at HOW I’m reacting to witnessing everything. What meaning are you attaching to it? What does it mean to you? Are you just assuming that it of course means xyz ? Or are you taking the time to analyze your predisposed reactions and weigh them with a rational mind? Are you running away Posts Why we believe this How this is what we’re doing because of it What this is the result This is who we are The reason why people say to meditate is to not only notice our Field of consciousNess but to understand deeply how attached it can be to our ever fleeting thoughts and reality that we have seemingly no control over. We can learn to step back rather than grasp on.

Feels like the time is right, before 2020 it was hard to know what suffering and mental health meant to people, how they could relate to it. Now we have this global moment in humanity of shared suffering that is mentally and emotionally effecting everyone every day in many ways. Mental health is at the forefront of the worlds attention. But people are vulnerable and spiritual exploration and self help have been historically murky with abuse of power and fear driven faith. From heightened polarization to the rise in fake news and global connectivity, deception runs rampant. It’s my mission for roseys to actively learn how to get to the roots of what’s true in ourselves and in the information we receive from the world.

Here are the roles and projects I'm currently hiring for along with some questions highlighted for you. I'd love to hear your thoughts and rates for each role. I've noted which roles apply to which projects in their descriptions for reference. Schedule would be determined later but I think I’d likely want to start Roseys social media and do the Airbnb initial shoot early July. ROLES 1) Social media support: Assume using existing content, starting with 3 reels and 3 posts per week, 1 story per day? I have a vision for the content and messages for each project but would love you to help execute and add your own expertise and creativity. Could we batch plan 1 month of content in advance? Then have you post, engage, have content ready for reels to sync to trending beats, tag available products etc.? We likely would not need DM support just yet for regular messages but could use support in DMing new followers and managing those convos if you’re interested. Would you follow/unfollow as well? 2) Lifestyle shoot: photography/videography - curate a shoot that tells a story and shares the lifestyle of the brand. 3-4 models. Maybe seasonal, so 1 shoot for 3 months of content? 3) Product shoot: - 3 photos per product on a model + 1 video clip in a lifestyle setting but optimized to capture the true color/detail and in a workflow to reduce shoot time. Since most products for these projects will be one-of-a-kind, we need to keep cost per photo down. We usually need about 3 photos per product, front/back/reversed plus one vibey video clip. Would love if you could help source models who are willing to shoot in exchange for content or product. Assume shooting 30 products for an estimate. 4) Airbnb shoot : This would be a combined lifestyle and product shoot with a model or two to showcase a new look for the Airbnb every time we revamp the vintage decor and add new products. We will need photos to replace the ones in our two existing listings linked below, along with shots of specific products in the space, and some lifestyle video clips. We would want to do one initial shoot with no product shots before we renovate. Links to listing photos below. Note, some shots wouldn’t have to be repeated (interior cabinets, closets, outdoors, etc) King Suite: https://abnb.me/bKuLwLSjuqb Sunroom Suite: https://abnb.me/bz1YL5Tjuqb Initial Shoot (one time, before shop is set up) 32 suite photos (~20 per suite) 10 lifestyle video clips per suite (5 per suite) Shop Shoot (reoccurring as we refurnish): 32 suite photos (16 per suite) 30 product shots (20 for Sunroom, 10 for King) 10 lifestyle video clips per suite (5 per suite) PROJECTS ROSEYS (Roles 1,2,3) Goal: Ramping up digital presence to build community and sales funnel. Roseys is preparing to relaunch this fall as a mindful lifestyle brand that’s radically good for the people and the planet and to grow a digital community around mindfulness and insight meditation. The business has been coasting through retail while I got Luna Wild online last year, but this summer I plan to ramp up Roseys’ digital presence to test and hone in on the strategies, aesthetics, audiences, and messages that best resonate Roseys’ mission to remind the world to look with love. In the fall, I plan to launch a new website for the re-envisioned lifestyle brand with new clothing, wearable art, and home products via The Rosey Place along with a library of mindful resources, and an invitation to join a digital community of perspective shifters. LUNA WILD (Roles 1,2,3) Goal: Promoting current products, monthly product drops, and brand mission. We have been growing Luna Wild’s website for the past year and are planning to scale up digital presence as we add more product drops and test advertising. This would be hired through Ashely but I’m managing her digital strategy and it’s still in the planning phase so I’ll relay what we discuss and bring her into the convo later. THE ROSEY PLACE (Roles 1,4) Goal: Building hype/following and launching shoppable climate positive Airbnb. This project is for two separate Airbnb guest suites that I host on the first floor of my house. Bad Madge vintage has agreed to furnish and decorate my two Airbnbs as I plan to redesign them into shoppable boutique accommodations that showcase mindfully sourced local products. They were just rated #1 vintage shop in the US on yelp! We’re still working out the logistics but as a starting point, I’m going to assume we would have a goal to revamp the spaces with new vintage products/art and furniture once a month (it may be longer at first). The spaces will also be a launching pad for new products that I’ll be adding to the Roseys brand. The images would be used on the website and Instagram @theroseyplace, likely cross posted on @badmadge, and used for PR.
